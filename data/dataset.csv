I could relate to the characters: the divorcee who's trying to get back in shape and the personal trainer who had a crush on said divorcee when he was a kid. The connection between the two characters is awesome. I love that the hunky hero is attracted to the plus-sized heroine.,Love it!,1397174400,0,0,5,1

"This book was a freebie that I got a while back on my Kindle.It's the story of a serial killer who travels the highway looking for hitchhikers. Once he gets them he enjoys killing and torturing them. After having enjoyed a kill earlier in the day, he sees a girl hitching under an overpass. He decides he's ready for a new kill. When he picks her up, he realizes she is not the defenseless female that he had thought.This short story is not for the squeamish, but is a twisted story of a serial killer. I thought it was a fun read.",Twisted,1383177600,0,0,4,1

"Ok,  it isn't completely free of holes in the plot.  Most books and movies have them if you spend time thinking about it.  I loved this book and hope she writes the sequel(s).  Much of the book takes place in Meagan's head and the conversations she holds with herself.  Very little of the dialogue is with her vampire lover or anyone else for that matter..  It felt comfortable and believable to me since that is where I spend much of my time - in my own head.  I rather enjoyed this style, although more actual conversations wouldn't have hurt the book(that is a note to the author if she reads this).  I want to know what happens when Meagan explores more of her capabilities as a witch.  I also enjoyed the fallible nature of the vampires in this world.  This was a great free read and I will willingly pay for the next book.",Good start to the series,1305331200,3,3,4,1
"I highly suggest getting this ebook! I agree with several other reviewers in that this is a unique take on a vampire story compared to those that are out there now. I don't want to go into any more details about the plot than others have because I am not wanting to spoil it. This story is the first of three. The sequel is Blood Hunt and I am hoping it will be available soon because I am anxious to read more! There were a few parts of the book that were skim worthy, but I believe it was because I was curious about the ending. I admit to being a bit impatient when the story grips me like this one. I was happy to find out about the story being continued. Congrats to the author!",LOVED IT!! :),1294358400,0,0,5,1

"This was an amazing story. I read it months ago before I started blogging or even knew what blogging was. It's haunted me ever since though since I never reviewed it once I did start blogging lol.The story centers around a nineteen year old girl named Selina whose only mission in life to heal with the special gift she was born with. However each healing she offers brings her closer to death, which is noted by the marking on her neck. Each time she heals the marking magically adds to itself until it encircles her neck and she dies.On this healing expedition she has to travel really far to heal the king of a neighboring kingdom. Despite being told not to go because the trek is dangerous, she knows she will die soon and it may be her only chance to have some adventure in her short life.She meets Faldon he's a shape shifter under a curse. He was once the leader of the Feyquin which are magical horses, the exact opposite of the well known Nitemares of many myths and lore. Faldon wants nothing more than to find the demon that cursed him and the human who shares his curse in the reverse fashion.He despises humans but something about Selina draws him to her and while they're friendship is rocky it's also strong.I found not one error in novella, so kudos to the editor!I absolutely loved this story. I without a doubt teared up at the end of it, my heart breaking for Faldon and Selina.I only wish this author had written a sequel so I could see what became of Faldon and the Feyquin, or even a prequel to learn more about Selina's life before this last trek.This is a great story and I think many people will love.I give this book 5 of 5 paws and apologize for the long delay in my review",Amazing Novella,1378598400,1,1,5,1

"In this prequel, we are sprung into a world where the society as we know it has fallen. People must barter for anything and something only belongs to you so long as you can keep someone else from stealing it. We watch as Elysia tries to steal some food using stealth and some hidden ability to not be seen. Darien watches from the crowd horrified that the woman he's been looking for is about to be killed. They help each other escape Baltimore on a boat and learn about their difficult past together. As they work towards going into the wilderness, they finally find out how to trust each other and then they meet their spirit guide who takes them to others who've answered the call to find a new way to live.This story is fast paced with chapters that are only a few pages long. I was worried at first that I wouldn't understand enough about the story with it being like that, but I was pleasantly surprised. This story definitely peaked my interest and took only a few hours to read. It coming as a prequel to the Aspect of Crow Trilogy and is well written.

"I recently read Turning Back the Clock. I was attracted to this book as a history buff who loves historical fiction. I had some concerns since I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I very quickly realized that I didn't have to be. This story pulled me in from page 1 and kept drawing me in until the very last page. I was also able to learn about a few events in the history of major league baseball that I was totally unaware of.

It was different than the other vamp books which are getting so predictable. There are twists that I have never seen explored in other vamp books I have read, but they enhance the story and dont ruin it. Some books go so far out, it ruins the fantasy.

"This was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.It was well written.  The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story.",Great story,1379203200,0,0,4,1

On what should be the happiest night of her life, her life was falling apart.  Catherine was going to have a baby, and now wasn't sure that she would have anyone to fill the father role.  She had planned a vacation for all of them, and now Rhys and Logan wouldn't even be there.  Everything was more important than she was.  She didn't even rank anymore.  So sure it was over, Catherine decided to go on the vacation to Jamaica alone to figure out what her next step was now that she was on her own.Rhys and Logan were panicked when they arrived home to find Catherine gone.  She had been gone for days, and they hadn't even known.  Figuring she went on vacation without them, they headed for Jamaica to get their woman back.  When they arrived, they couldn't believe how distant and withdrawn she was.  Rhys and Logan knew how abominably they had treated her not just recently, but for years.  That sad fact had become abundantly clear, and there was no one to blame except themselves.  Catherine had always been there loving them, and they were no longer sure she would stay with them.  Rhys and Logan had a lot of hurt to make up for, and would stop at nothing to convince Catherine she would always come first.MB has done it again!

"Irish author and poet James Lawless was born in Dublin, read Irish and Spanish at the University College Dublin, followed by honors studies in Communications and Cultural Studies at Dublin City University. He has been both a secondary schools teacher and a guest lecturer as well as volunteering for social concerns organizations. His highly successful career has been molded by not only his gifts as a poet, a writer of short stories, and a novelist (he is widely published) but also by his concerns with humanitarian issues and political histories. He currently has homes in both County Kildare and West Cork.FOR LOVE OF ANNA, Lawless' second novel is a story of love, ideology and corruption. The author wisely introduces his own summary of the novel, guiding the reader to the important themes: ""There are three main strands running through this novel. Firstly, it may be read as a poignant love story - Anna is a ballerina with whom the main protagonist, the university student, Guido van Thool, falls in love. But Anna is also an acronym for Anarchists of the New Age, which brings us to the second dimension of the novel as an ideological story positing ideas in the mind of the philosophy student Guido, in the wake of the collapse of Russian communism and the dilution of oppositional politics, on what alternatives there are to the all-devouring monolith of corporate capitalism. Anna wants to steer him away from this sort of 'dangerous' thinking, but his friend, the anarchist Philippe, keeps goading him. Paralleling the lives of the lovers is that of a corrupt judge, Jeremiah Delahyde (the third strand) who literally crashes into the world of Guido and Anna on a fatal New Years night."" Anna's death at the hands of the drunken Delahyde in an auto `accident' sets into action a line of revenge by Guido - a move that ties the three threads of the novel together tightly. Love, passion, philosophy, the arts, devotion, anti-globalization marches all play major roles here. It is an engrossing novel that marries a passionate love against examples of what power does to people, how a single turn of events can create a chain reaction of incredible proportions and leads even the most nave of people to act in unimaginable ways.Lawless writing is mesmerizing. Once he establishes each of his characters he has seared them on our minds, and all the complexities of the interaction of human love, the exigencies that corruption consumes power, and the even greater issues of morality become increasingly focused until the novel's brilliant end. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, February 14",A searing story from an increasingly impressive Irish writer,1391299200,1,1,5,1

"I still can't believe the low price for this story...do not assume that the low price equates to low quality...far from it!  Though set in a post-apocalyptic world that has seen civilization reduced to simple survival, it is not dismal.  There is much hope, especially expressed by those who must learn to persevere and endure, finding a way to reconnect with humanity again.  The romantic tension is intriguing and exciting between the central characters, but what moves the story forward are the questions that naturally arise:  What would those who survived after a global collapse do?  How do they begin to rebuild?  Can humanity endure?  And yes, even the cheesy, can love overcome all obstacles?  Ultimately, these ideas are what resonate most and make this story a keeper.  Try it.

"J.C. Wilder has presented us with an intense book which grabbed my attention at the first and never let go. This contemporary romance had a sensuality score that shot through the roof. This definitely is not for the timid reader. For the adventurous reader, however, this is the book to read.Wilder's characters were vibrant, likeable people which kept me turning the pages. The myriad of supporting players in this book meshed together to create an above-average saga. The storyline pivoted around the long-time love story between two people who couldn't quite forget the other. Nine years left a time gap, but one Wilder was able to capture in her unique way.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a sizzling romance with lots of twists and turns on the way to its happily-ever-after.

"High school teacher Kelly Finch is furious when Mr. Hallstrom, the principal, tells her that her class will be used to search out active gang members in the school. She is partnered with Lieutenant Jared ""Mac"" McNally whose arrogant and cynical attitude just rubs her the wrong way. If only he didn't attract her so much she could concentrate on what needed to be done and actually get the assignment done.Mac immediately rises to the challenge when Kelly protests against using her class for his operation. She sees him as a judgmental person who is out to trap her students before they've had a chance to escape their terrible home lives. Their tempers rise as they both refuse to back down, but so does their passion. When they disagree on a certain student, Kelly lets her pride influence a decision that could put her in grave danger.Covert Lessons by Mari Carr was an interesting read. The storyline was fast-paced and easy to relate to. Mac and Kelly's tempers soon give way to a push and pull passion they try to put off in order to keep up professional ethics. When they spend time together, learning the backgrounds on Kelly's students, a deep friendship and bond is formed. The sexual chemistry between the two characters eventually explodes and it is scorching! I loved the flow of the story and the ending was thrilling. I could not put it down.

Loneliness sends him to The Chicken Ranch looking for temporary company. Declan and Killian's time together at The Ranch is explosive. A few months later, a chance meeting reunites Killian and Declan and they decide to take the next step. Will Declan's career get in the way of what could be the best thing that ever happened to him?I really like the dynamics between Declan and Killian in Hunger. They are genuinely sweet guys and they take their relationship slow. Because of their unconventional meeting, it seems impossible that they could have a relationship, but it works. It was hard for me to accept that Declan is a prostitute, and that he continues to `work' while he and Killian are dating, but Killian is surprisingly okay with it. Killian's nervous stuttering is endearing and Declan's painful past is sad, Overall, Hunger is a good story starring two charming men.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Chicken Ranch,1269561600,1,1,5,1

"If you are always looking for captivating engaging books that will keep you absorbed and yet not end too fast, then both of the first two books of this series are a welcome treat.I actually found the first book to be the better of the two, perhaps more because the characters are great and there is a good solid mystery that is the focus of much of it.The second book had some great development, creative challenges, and overall action which keeps one reading all the way to the end and wanting more.There are about three things that hold me back from giving 5 stars:- no real oomph or focus for reflection after reading the entire books - these books are meant to be read just once- by the middle of the 2nd book you get the feeling that the story might be getting a little formulaic, or bogged down- While the characters are good here and change over time, I only give five stars to books that bring a little more out.So, at the prices, for the fun of reading, and for their length...these are definite buys but don't expect much more than that.

"I recently discovered this author because of an anthology with three other authors and really enjoyed her dark, gritty voice so before purchasing any full lengths I wanted to try out another novella. I was not disappointed!Meli Galdes is ready to retire from her position as an assassin for her family, but they want her to do one more job: kill the man who broke her heart and ruined her life, forcing her into excise (basically she was publicly considered a leper to her family though she did their dirty work). Celino Carvanna broke Meli's heart when she was young in a callous way, but that's not what destroyed Meli. She could forgive his youth. He took away her freedom with his actions and even though he hadn't realized what he'd done in that aspect (can't say what without giving away spoilers) she still wanted him to pay for what he'd done, though not in the way her family wanted so she could truly be free of him.Both Meli and Celino are products of a harsh society and I like that their actions and decisions weren't glossed over. Meli was an assassin but she had a moral code and a soft side. And while Celino was a brutal businessman and an all out dangerous man, he was very tender with her. This was a very emotional story and the ending wasn't immediately wrapped up with a neat bow which I liked. They had to work for their happy ending. For such a short story, this author packed an incredible emotional punch so even though the ending was a little abrupt, it whet my appetite for more from this interesting world.",Big emotional punch in a small package,1325116800,2,2,5,1

In YOU SEND ME, we travel back in time to the summer when a young Millie first visited Moose Falls, and learn just why the town meant so much to her for the rest of her days.Although a novella, YOU SEND ME is no less poignant for the brief length.

Still haunted by the ravages of the war he fought in, Johnny finds a comfort in Millie that heals his wounded soul.

"This book has elements of just about everything in it.  It started off as realistic fiction.  Girl meets boy, who somehow ends up staying with the girl's family.  But added to that is that the boy, Jesse, has flashbacks about his past, and visions of a boy he has never met, while having conversations with something that could be a computer.  And, if that isn't enough, he also has fire-starting and healing powers.It is quite well-written, even with the confusion of so many genres appearing in the same book.  It was also highly entertaining, mostly because you never knew what was going to happen next.  I couldn't stop reading it, mainly because I kept having to decipher just what was happening.As I read on, I could understand the title of this book.  In some ways, Jesse was a ghost.  Someone who was there, but who wasn't who he thought he was.  I really liked his vulnerability.  He held a lot of guilt over his past and a belief that he was better off alone.  He also had to live with the gifts he had been given - even if he considered some of them a curse.  He's also trying to find out who he is.  What teenager doesn't ask themselves at one time who they are?  I know I did.  And that's what draws me to this book - the underlying realism to it - even when it's anything, but that.Some of the scenes written are very intense and I wonder if L. Lee Lowe wrote purely for fun or if there was some hidden meaning behind the writing.  In one scene, the one with the man hanging from the tree, it felt almost spiritual to me.  As if Jesse had to put something to rest before he could move on.  Like letting go of his past so he could live the life he should be living and not the one he was.  And, I know it may only be me reading into it, but it reminds me of Shakespeare's 'As you like it' - 'All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players...'  In some ways that's how it feels.  It's like Jesse is a puppet with someone else pulling the strings, especially with Red and the others.Sarah, another character, is what held Jesse together.  She's the one who gives him hope.  She goes through a similar hell to Jesse and yet at the same time different.  In some ways, she's also his downfall or at least the guys she hung around with were. There are other characters I adore as well, like Sarah's dad, Finn.  He gave Jesse support when he needed it and was there for him when no other male figure was.This whole novel was complicated, gave me hope of a happy ending for the characters, and was bittersweet.  I can't go to much into why it's bittersweet because it would contain spoilers.  I didn't consider the book a light read, well, it was a light read at the start and evolved from there.  To be honest, some of it I didn't understand at all, mainly because, as I mentioned earlier, there was more than one or two genres in it.  But even so, it didn't stop me from liking it.  The book is also longer than most, so it will take more time to read.I think this book is best suited to someone who prefers a challenging book, because that's how I found it.And now, since I don't have anything more to add, here is my rating :- four out of five stars.",Book Review from Sandy at Magical Manuscipts,1347148800,0,0,4,1
"Dee crafts an exciting story of time travel and love with ""Under A Viking Moon."" Katla 'Kat' Jonsdottir and Leif Nabboddrson are two people destined never to meet until a time traveling pendant brings them together. Can the sparks that have ignited between them keep the couple together?Dee's writing is exciting. The story immediately grabs the reader's attention and doesn't let go. The story plot is tight. The dialogue is authentic to both times. Dee captures the worlds of 2006 San Francisco and 900 A.D. Denmark with amazing accuracy.The characters are compelling. The reader meets Kat at a certain point in her life and throughout the novel, Kat shows true courage in all her challenges. It's a raw courage that has to be refined. Her defining moment is when she helps Leif's father, and his family, learn to live with his dementia. Leif also has his own problems to deal with. After making Kat his slave, he must learn to live the consequences. It's not easy for him. He has to learn to do what is right despite what society dictates is right.The novel is sensual for romance readers. The love scene is tasteful.

"I was flipping through the pages ofDark Knight in Disguise II: Earthbound Angels 1 (Earthbound Angels Book 1)sinking my fangs into a delightful story about this angel who protested about human kind so many times that it earned him the opportunity to live among them as a lesson, then I felt a hankering in my glands for a little vampire drama.First of I don't like the name Prophecy for a character but I eventually swallowed it after a few chapters. Loved the plot. The idea that Valentine was actually duty bound to expose her to the law keepers, he instead feels drawn to her and becomes torn between duty and desire. I get chills whenever the desire for another forces you to go against your beliefs.Prophecy has been in the dark for a very long time and when she finally steps out into the light it is like another birth taking place. Her attraction to Valentine is dangerous and dare I say fatal but he ironically is her only hope to escape from the clutches of the very people he was duty bound to. It's quite a pickle of a situation when you think about it.Valentine has a lot to lose but Prophesy seems to be worth the sacrifice. I would compare this story to stumbling upon a diamond in the rough. The finder sees the beauty that no one else sees. The Law Keepers are hell bent on destroying Valentine's diamond but he isn't willing to just relinquish his find that easily. As there journey unfolds, the writer builds a world that is absolutely unique.I would say that the over embellished character descriptions and repeated use of some of the same phrases was off putting but there are those who like for their pictures to be as cluttered as possible. As for me, toning down on the descriptions is like putting a stunning woman in a long white dress that reveals very little skin. Its so much more fun trying to undress her in your mind than to have her just appear completely bare. It's the mystery that I like.The fact that although Valentine is a vampire he is of a different bloodline and therefore forbidden, reminds me all to well of the issues that some people still face in the world today because of ignorance. The rules are clear but what good are rules if they cannot be broken? You wouldn't have to tell me twice to follow my heart especially when it tells me to fall in the arms of one so dark and sensuous as Valentine.I was thoroughly pleased with this story however slightly dismayed by the end. I needed some closure on a few things. The end was to big of a cliff hanger for me. It just felt unfinished, but never the less it left me wanting- no desperate for the sequel.I would recommend this book with a four star approval. It's good, stimulating, dark, romantic, loads of hidden messages and great writing from the author. The fate of the world hangs in the balance and if you want to know just how Prophecy and Valentine can change that well you need to do like me and start at the beginning with this book then move on very quickly to the next installment.",A Diamond In the Rough,1361491200,0,0,4,1

"Finding Home by Cameron DaneI liked this story and how the years passed for Adam and Rhone making them best buds turned lovers.  I liked how you saw the friendship progress and the growth of Adam from a street kid to a successful businessman.  Rhone gave Adam an opportunity when his family kicked him to the curb like unwanted rubbish. It was nice to see how Adam became part of the Quinn team and by extension family.  This story really is about Adam and his struggle with his homosexuality and ever growing attraction to the man that in essence rescued him.Now on to my buts...First is the length 8 Chapters.Second the verbiage to describe their sexual organs i.e. poking pole, piss-slit and nut sack...Seriously;)Third is that I couldn't believe Rhone one minute is vertical and then he pulls a 180 and is horizontal and in love with Adam.

"Cowboys and G ay Romance are quite a popular pair, and it has also almost always an angst feeling. This story is about a ranch in Montana and two cowboys who are grieving for the loss of the same man. Simon was Dylan's brother and Wade's lover; it was Dylan who introduced Simon to Wade and doing that it made of Wade an happy man and of himself a desperate one. Dylan was in love with Wade but Wade has never seen in him as nothing more than a friend. And when Wade found his happiness with Simon, Dylan was able to accept it since he loved Simon as much as he loved Wade if not more. But then Simon died in a car accident while driving with Dylan, and Dylan had not the courage to stay and see the sorrow in Wade's eyes, he dreaded the question, why did Simon die and did you not? To not loose also the best friend after losing the brother, Dylan severed any contact, loosing in this way also his family.Years later Dylan is called back home: Wade's ranch is decaying as it's doing his owner. Without his lover by his side, and having lost also his best friend, Wade was unable to cope and let it everything go waste. Dylan knows that he can let it happen and he decides to be again Wade's best friend. But when Wade asks for more, Dylan has to understand if the man is searching a substitute for his lost lover, or if he is ready to love again.Even if quite sad, the story is almost a sweet romance. There is more speaking of feelings than s exy scenes. The mood is definitely not light, but the story is very romantic. And there is the undisputed acceptance of Wade and Dylan's, and previously Simon's, s exuality, without trouble, with only love. There are not opponents to their love. The troubles between Wade and Dylan are of different nature, it's a question of too much unasked questions.The strange thing is that I really think that Simon's death is the only reason why Wade and Dylan have a chance to be happy together, and it's not so obvious: Wade was really in love with Simon and I don't think he would have been the same with Dylan before. Wade and Dylan are too similar, they would have been probably shifted in an ordinary and boring life together, and sooner or later they would have split. Simon is the glue that sticks them together. With Simon, Wade had the chance to taste what is a passionate love; without Simon, Dylan had the chance to live outside the ranch. Now, both Wade than Dylan know what they want to be happy, and they know that they can have it together.Side note: Dakota Flint paid an homage to James Buchanan, a supporting character on the novel was reading The Good Thief and was enthralled by the story.",Seeing You by Dakota Flint,1264636800,4,4,5,1
"This is yet another story full of humanly flawed characters from Diana Bold. She doesn't shy away from hurtful emotions in her stories, which I absolutely love about her books. She makes you believe that these people could exist in the real world--in fact I believe I know a few of them.As the daughter of a duke, Natalia knows that she must someday do her duty and marry where her father commands. However, this has not stopped her from dreaming about a war hero who seems to be nothing like the men of society--who only see her large dowry when they look at her. She has built up the reputation as a cold lady who follows her own strict rule of not allowing two dances to the same gentleman at a ball. In reality, she doesn't wish to encourage any man who she knows will not meet with her father's approval. Dylan is the unloved, unwanted second son of an earl. Having sold his commission, he is down on funds and sees no harm in participating in a silly wager--get a cold fish of a girl to dance with him twice. Only the girl is warm and kind and seems to see through him like no one else ever cared to. He never counted on losing his heart but he may have just wagered more than he bargained to lose.I could totally relate to Natalia--who feared being wanted for something other than herself. She had flaws just like any girl. She was insecure, had a heartfelt desire to be wanted, a hard time forgiving and was perhaps a little immature in her daydreams. But all of that is real. The same could be said with all of Diana's heros'. I just started reading her books recently. I've found again and again that she writes all of them with the same passion and dedication. To be as true to life as possible. No cookie cutter, perfect do-no-wrong hero for her! He must be a Man. With a Man's flaws and insecurities.

When they find him they don't expect to find a little spitfire of a woman standing up to him.Dakota won't sell out her land to ""Big Ed"" no matter what he throws at her. Through fires, attacks and even stolen cattle she has held strong.  Heck the man even hired her former ""boyfriend"" away.  She has grown leery of people, especially as no one in town will help her.  When Joe and Colt show up on her property looking for work she tries to send them on their way.  Once they figure out she is the one standing alone against ""Big Ed"" they decide to take only yes for an answer.Dakota figures they will only stay long enough to be scared away but until then they are handy to have around and they definitely improve the scenery.  But will she be able to act on her lustful feelings or will she discover why they are really on her ranch?  Are they each what the other needs to heal and have a strong life together?Leah Brooke knows how to weave a couple of alpha cowboys into an interesting storyline with strong women.  Dakota's Cowboys continues to prove this fact and is the latest in the Dakota Heat series.  I enjoyed the interaction between Dakota and the new men in her life, and how she still sticks to her convictions and does what she feels is her job no matter what the men think.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Dakota's Cowboys,1265155200,3,3,5,1

"Sisypuss. True, it is a title you might find hard to pronounce. You might want to call it ""Sissy puss"" and then blush about it, roll your eyes, or laugh, but I can tell you now, this book is no joke. I would say Patricia Halloff's book now ranks in the top five books of all I have read this year.If you are an animal lover, even if you are not; if you have a beating heart that society hardens from time to time, and you yearn for some emotion to remind you just how fragile life really is sometimes, how life could be much worse for you, then I encourage you to sit and spend a night with this book. It is some of the most brilliant, heartfelt, poignant writing that I have read in some time.The name of the book comes from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a king whose punishment was to roll a large boulder up a hill endlessly, only to have to watch it roll back down. Doomed to repeat this process over and over again throughout eternity, the word sisyphean is often used to described a task that is unending, pointless, and repetitive. Now, think about those words for a moment and think about how perfect they are as descriptions of stray pets, cats and dogs left on the streets to fend for themselves. They fight for food and shelter, fending off prey and sickness, often running away from the hands of abusive owners. Yep, it's a cruel world and the abuse is unending. Enter Sisypuss.From page one, when Sisypuss is born to a sickly mother who is near death , we are shown a grim world with no hope in sight. The entire book is told from the point-of-view of Sisypuss the cat and his outlook on the sinister unforgiving world. Think of the skinny cat you've seen in the alley behind your house, or the animal shelter you pass every day on the way to work. Think of the animal testing facilities that we deny exist. Ms. Halloff leaves no stone unturned when it comes to the harsh reality of the way animals are treated in this country. It is very real. It is no Greek myth.Being an animal lover myself and owning two cats, I have to admit this book is not the happy fairytale cliche I was probably expecting. It is, however, a wake up call that the treatment of animals is something we should be concerned about.  Those of you who may not like books with animals as the central characters, don't stop reading now.There are humans in this story, but their central existence as secondary characters only serves the purpose of showing the relationship between humans and animals, as pets, and the delicate boundaries between our world and theirs.  But again, these plot lines are no walk in the park.  Booley, Sisypuss's main owner, is battling drug use.There is an array of other characters, both human and animal, that will definitely keep the pages turning.  At times, Halloff's vivid writing will leave a coppery taste in your mouth.  Your chest will hurt from your heart crying out.  You may even hang your head in shame for not doing anything to help our furry friends.  But above all this, you will come away from this book never once regretting the time you spent reading it.  You will learn something, and hopefully we'll make change.  Bravo to Patricia Halloff because her clever and informative writing demands that change!","A book, not just for animal lovers, which we can all learn from..",1218931200,2,2,5,1

"This book has to be one of my top 10 favorites. I love the Character of Hunt Jamison; he was brutal, brazen, and honest to fault. He spoke what was on mind and found myself smiling and liking it. I felt bad for him at times because like Hunt I have a scar on my face from a car accident and I was embarrassed by it and sometime I'm still am, so I related to the character so much. I loved Lila character as well she tried her best not to fall for him while trying to keep her dignity. I like that the ""Write"" didn't make them fall in love so quick and like I said the honesty of Hunter and plain-spokenness is so needed in others writers' characters.

John is no longer a young man, pushed around by his father and Mallory is no longer his teenage bride. They literally run away from the soiree due to John's crooked uncle Louis embezzling John's funds and leaving him broke and to a mob of people to whom he owes money. Mallory has lost her home due to not receiving help from her absent husband and she wants a divorce so she can marry an old friend.

"I have to say that if you like books with Hot, strong alpha males. Then this is the bundle for you. There are 3 stories in here. These books are about werewolves. They are packed full of action, romance and excitement. Each story has it's own little adventure and they follow each other. So if you read these books and you don't get the bundle make sure you read them in order. But I do have to say that the last story was my favorite. It was so heart felt. You have to read it to understand. You feel sorry for the guy. But done worry he has a happy ending. So I would recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal stories. Now I see that she has another book out now that follows these 3 stories. The name of that is Dark Wolf Rising. Now off the read it. I see that it has good reviews.  I also hope that the character Cian (the Irishman) is in the next book. For he was in all of the other's so far and he is a hoot. You just got to love him.P.S.

"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne?  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work.  It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism.  With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook.  Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may.  The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste.  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the `science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the ""speculative"" portion to explore human nature.  Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this.  And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost.  However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well.  We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions.  The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed.  Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular ""twenty thousand leagues"" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks.  There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly.  Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base.  Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as ""inoffensive creature[s],"" he gleefully slaughters a herd of ""cruel, mischievous"" sperm whales.  Hardly sustainability at its best.  But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology.  Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design).  Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented.  Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by ""foul air.""Verne wrote at an exciting time.  The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid.  We were just beginning to understand electricity.  The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered.  Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon.  There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion.  Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given.  It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword.  I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968.  It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would).  These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel.  It also contains a ""backword"" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine.",The Original Science Fiction Classic,1321920000,1,1,4,1

"Amsterdam 2012Don't open this book until you have a lo-o-o-ng amount of free time in front of you. Otherwise you'll find yourself doing what I was doing this morning: trying to tie your shoes and read at the same time.A realistic, believable, nightmare. One of the best novels I have read in quite a long time. The opener hints at a small amount of overly workshopped material, but by the fourth page you're into a major page-turner. In the entire book I found four misused words and one misspelled foreign word, but I've been an editor and writing teacher more than twenty-five years. I don't think anybody else would notice them.Each peak leads inexorably toward the next peak, so that it's very hard for me to say anything substantive that wouldn't be a spoiler. But maybe this, about a quarter of the way in, will work:""This is great, I thought, my boyfriend is being held as a terrorism suspect, my brother is a Nazi, and my sister is a Muhammad groupie."" A few pages before or after this, the narrator refers to her parents as liberals. When the book begins, the narrator is a prototypical rich liberal college kid on her European backpacking tour with her boyfriend. When the book ends . . . .No, you're going to have to go and read it for yourself.",World War III from the Inside - a Winner,1265155200,23,23,5,1
"I went into this book with very few expectations and I was very pleasantly surprised.  I love the characters of Will, Jenny and even Christian.  They were all likeable and felt real.  I loved how Will's sweet shyness totally meshed with Jenny's outgoing personality. The story was well-paced and definitely kept my attention.  So, it's mostly all good.The only thing that bothered me was the assault.  Only because it seemed kind of forced and out of the blue.  I would have much rather had Will's secrets be revealed by him confiding them to Jenny in a different situation - including the fact that she was his first everything.  I couldn't imagine that piece of information never coming out. It just seems too important to leave out of their story.Good read.  I'd recommend it.",Sweet and hot,1354320000,1,1,4,1

"The first half of the book, imo, lacks cohesion. The characters are not very developed. I never understood going from not knowing each other to joking like they had been doing it for years. The story line jumps around and it can be really confusing. And somewhat boring. As is the debating about morality and vampires.But about half way through, it all changes. I still don't see WHY the character's came together, but the story from now on makes sense.I am looking forward to the next books in this series.","It gets better about half way through, then it's fantastic.",1296518400,0,0,4,1

The ""attacks"" cause her to scream the loudest most insane horrifying scream imaginable.  This lands her in a psych ward for teens.It ends with her being sent home to live her life and go back to school which is where book 1 starts.

"I cried real splishy splashy tears, the mark of a good book. This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars. I'm sure someone has written about similar things but this felt original to me.The Christian aspect I'd give 5 stars also. It is very appropriate for the intended YA audience but also appealing to a much wider age range. I could see reading this book in a homeschool setting. I guess because there are so many nuggets of truth hidden in there. It's about Heaven. It's about bad things happening for a reason. It's about deciding for yourself what matters most in life. It's a really good book!I am working on his short story collection next.Note: I wasn't asked to review this book and I bought my own copy. I'm a blogger and I have access to tons of free books.

"Second in a series featuring those hot, 6'5"" blond god twins Kasey and Garret Johnson, this one centers on rapidly rising movie star, openly gay Garrett.  He begins this tale on the road in Charlotte, North Carolina where he is to be tutored in the art of NASCAR driving (for an upcoming role) by CJ Lamont, one of the leading riders on the circuit, a beautiful and privately tortured soul who is struggling with his marriage because of his hidden secret--he's gay.  Like its predecessor Out of Bounds, this one is far more believable in 2014 than it might have been when first published in 2009, but it is nonetheless an extraordinarily researched and brilliantly developed love story with holdover characters from the first book playing crucial roles.  This one gets into gear smoothly, builds energy around every wild turn, and finishes with a tremendous burst of speed so that we can all relax when the gang crosses the finish line.",Rev it up for a wild ride,1400112000,0,0,5,1

The psychos of course can not trust each other (lots of fun watching them ""connect"") and the cop hasn't been a survivor for nothing.

I believe this would make a great movie, and I've even got the actor picked out!Other reviewers have described the plot so there is no need for me to go there.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because of the numerous misspelled words, incomplete sentences, and other grammatical problems which were terribly distracting. After finishing the book I looked at the credits and saw this was originally published in 1995.

"This is a book that can be read on many levels.  It is fun, humorous, and filled with a bit of magic.  Yet it develops the theme of overcoming old wounds which is one I particularly love to read.  I picked it up after reading and liking another book of hers, His Majesty Prince of Toads.The fun premise is a magical brew (a love potion)that is causing all the bachelor's to marry. The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.",Rogues Get Caught,1290902400,6,6,4,1

"I have a hard time reading on-line for enjoyment and I don't own one of those portable readers yet.  That's to explain why it took me quite a long time to read this volume.Once I did get to reading, I found this book virtually hard to put down.  Sage is a wonderful fantasy kingdom described for the reader by the main character. Demetria is a plant wizard with the ability to control and speak to plant life, which does tend to make them grow very well.  Her husband, Ward, is a dungeon master who can control stone.All of the inhabitants of Sage have some type of magical affinity, whether to plants, stone, animals, and a variety of other talents.The Rats who live in a neighboring kingdom, however, are not amiable with the humans of Sage.  Therein lies much of the conflict in these stories. In the first tale, the Rats have sent a plague of rotten mold into Sage.  Who better to fight this menace than Demetria, the master gardener? With great personal sacrifice, Demetria, assisted by other wizards, fights off the slime threatening her land.In the second story, Demetria and Ward must rescue their son from the Rat Kingdom. They get some surprising help from those believed to be the guilty parties.Okay, I'm writing this review before I've read the third tale, however, I will absolutely do so and know I will enjoy the heck out of it.  I've become a Demetria fan.  I look forward to seeing more tales from the land of Sage.  But, Maria, let's get this book in print so I can take it to bed with me.

She wants that corner office in the law firm in which she works but also wants to spend time with her family.  When Rafe, her brother's best friend and the object of her late night fantasies since high school, kisses her under the mistletoe hanging in his hallway, Belle realizes that what she used to think was important, just might not be any longer.Rafe Bettencourt has been in love with Belle since she graduated from law school.  Finding himself in love with his best friend's baby sister is tough enough but Rafe has to compete with the lists and goals that Belle obsessively makes for herself.  He needs to convince her that life with him would be way better than any list she could ever make.To Do List was a new and fully anticipated experience for me. Lauren Dane is one of my favorite authors and I think this was the first totally contemporary romance that I have read written by her.  To Do List made me giggle simply because I COULD HAVE BEEN Belle.  Famous in my family for my lists, I so empathized with her need to be organized and loved how her quirkiness endeared her to Rafe. I simply loved Rafe because he loved Belle.  His patience with her, even when he was dying for her to come to grips with their relationship, was appealing to me and I just simply desired him for my very own.Readers used to reading Lauren Dane's outstanding fantasy and shape shifter novels need to give To Do List a try.

"PLOT: Lucas walks up to Nita in a club to avoid an ex-girlfriend who'd broken his heart. Nita's really not his type, but after they share a kiss, he can't forget about her. Nita is drawn to Lucas despite knowing that he's not the type to commit.PROS: Nita and Lucas were sweet together. They really opened up to one another. Nita was likeable.The plot was well handled. I liked the added bit of mystery that Deandre's character contributed. I didn't think I'd like the story of a woman trying to choose between two men, but it's always obvious whom she prefers.CONS: The novel could afford to be proofread one more time. It wasn't as bad as some I've seen. I can only recall one misspelled word. There were numerous times when the author left a word out of a sentence. What she meant to say was understandable, but at times, the left out word would change the meaning of the sentence.Nita and Lucas decided they were in love a little too quick. It just wasn't believable.4 STARS: This second book in the City Wolf series is better than the first. The characters are more rounded and mature. Also the plot is more interesting.

"Not since reading The Amityville Horror and The Exorcist have I read such a creepy story. As the product description described, there were unexplained deaths that took place in this house. The police in the town hate to get calls reporting weird goings on at Manchester House. The police have decided to let a team of 'ghost hunters' into the house to investigate and finally figure out and get rid of the evil spirits that reside there. What ensues is a grisly account of what happens to this team as they enter the basement of this evil house. I did enjoy this story as I sometimes like to read a spine tingling horror story. I did see that there were some areas that needed to be edited, or maybe it was because this was a Kindle copy. The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of vomiting going on in this story. I suppose though if I encountered what the ghost hunter team did I would be ill too. If you want to read a good scary story then this one is for you.",Manchester House,1280361600,2,2,4,1

"Sterling is a wonderful character in how he doesn't want to submit, but he needs to. He is stubborn enough to convince Owen to take him on, despite being new to the scene. I love the friction between them. It's a long story, though it does leave out a lot of the scenes that the reader wishes was there. Sterling will mention having enjoyed a scene with Owen, and it's disappointing not being able to read about it and not seeing Sterling's at that moment reactions.

They meet in a cafe, and it doesn't take long for either of them to realize that fate has brough them together for a reason. As you might have guessed, however, true love is never simple.

"Burial to Follow is the kind of fascinating story I have come to expect from Scott Nicholson: intriguing, suspenseful plot, vivid details, and an insightful depiction of human motives, yearnings, and desires. The perfect blend of real and surreal elements, of the macabre and the humorous makes for a delightful read. Scott's stories and novels have a local, Southern flair (and if you are interested in delicious Southern food, this is the story for you) but speak to readers everywhere. The mixture of true sorrow, barely contained greed, and hypocrisy which is part of so many family funerals and inheritance battles rings true, no matter where you live. And what a surprise ending! But for that you have to read the story.","Fascinating, insightful, wicked, and humorous",1263427200,19,19,5,1

Whoever wrote the synopsis of the story did not read it.  She wasn't trying to drive him away with sweetness.  She really was sweet.  Though apparently not to sweet to casually give away her virginity.  But give her credit she is smart enough not to mention it to him and get away with it.  No real point to telling him.  I know some readers felt that she should have remained a virgin because of the time period.  But unfortunately girls have been talked out of it by the wrong guy throughout history.

"Rebecca Forster continues to impress with the exceptional character development and human weaknesses that she instills in each person.  From my first Forster novel I have been impressed with her writing ability, her attention to detail and most especially her skill at describing a scene, an emotion, and a character to the degree that the reader feels a part of the story.In this novel, more of a suspense than the first legal thriller I read (Silent Witness) the story is extraordinary in the sense that the revelations that occur throughout the final third of the book are not easily predicted.  The ""who done it"" component of this mystery continues until the final page, literally.  Even then the reader is surprised, perhaps even frustrated, by the conclusion.I have no hesitation in recommending anything written by Ms. Forster.

"'The heat sent mirage waves up from the ground, making the air in the distance wiggly and unfocused. Payce eyed the endless highway that ran through the desert toward the city the cops liked to call The Adult Disneyland and sped the unmarked car toward the first homicide scene of the day. Gavin sat silently in the passenger seat taking in the long highway and the endless desert around them. As they headed into town, a handful of cars passed them by, some filled to the brim with would-be partiers; others having one lone driver heading away from the one-armed bandits that ate up wages like candy.'The year is 2032. The place is Las Vegas. The crime is crucifixion. Payce Halligan and her new partner Gavin McAllister are in route to their first crime together. After the death of her last partner, Payce became a loner and resented her boss coupling her with someone new, especially a foreigner. Gavin left Scotland Yard, after loosing his wife and son, to start life over. He was impressed with what he saw in his new partner but had a feeling that she might end up being a real problem for him. But Payce and Gavin pushed their baggage from the past aside and jumped into their first crime together.. the death of a woman hanging from an inverted cross.As I read Crucifying Angel I had one author and book come to mind.. Stephen King and The Stand. P. I. Barrington has picked up where King left off with his story about Vegas. Reading Crucifying Angel was like riding a roller coaster that went up and up and when you thought it was time for it to come down it simply dropped a few feet and continued to climb. It's story, characters and time setting are all very realistic and believable. And the ending?

"This little short story is one of the many (actually, one of the most important) reasons I love my Kindle and e-books.  This little offering by Theresa Weir was a delight from the first sentence on.  What a creative mind Weir has.The other reviewers here have given a very nice little rundown on the plot so I will not linger long on that aspect of the story.  Max, while in utero, wrote his first novel on the wall of his mother's uterus.  Then, as bad luck would have it, he was born.  Max spends the better part of his life in remorse having lost his novel, and trying to recapture that magic time.I found myself chuckling several times and actually laughing at least twice while reading this thing.  The tongue in cheek wit is catching in a subdued and subtle way...the author uses perfect timing when she uses her ""punch line.""  But, as other reviewers have pointed out, there is a certain reality at play here and we get a very nice peek into the inside of a writer's soul...if that is what you want to call it.  I was amused during most of the book, yet just a wee bit saddened and concerned at the same time.What ever the emotion, Theresa Weir most certainly knows how to tell a story.  There was not one thing about this entire tale that I did not enjoy.These short stories that you are able to download at any time are wonderful.  They have taken the place of the old magazine giants of decades past, where a reader could plunk down some change and for relatively little money, have a very good reading experience.  The days of those great old publications are long gone now and they left a horrible void for those of us who love reading.

What I mean by that, is that when very different people come together and form a healthy relationship.  For example, the relationship between Dagger, one of the main characters, and the schizophrenic man or the relationship between Dagger and the cop he called Padre, because the cop used to be a priest.All of the characters are strong, they have both strengths and weaknesses.

"Second in the Dragon Knights series, which is a different take on dragonriders; it resembles Anne McCaffrey's Pern books but is definitely for adult readers. The story starts with Lord Darian of Skithdron bedding a woman in a palace in order to gain access to secrets. He then decides that Lord Venerai and his ruler King Lucan are both deranged and evil.Two neighouring kingdoms, Draconia and Skithdron, are at odds and while the former boasts dragons as native beings, the latter has venomous serpentine beasts called skiths. These usually solitary creatures are being controlled for use in warfare by King Lucan. Adora, a healer woman, has just been seriously wounded by skiths and saved by a dragon, and now she is resting in the BORDER LAIR while her injuries heal. An older dragon knight called Jared, bonded to a female dragon called Kelzy, is caring for her and gradually falling for the courageous woman. Prince Nico of Draconia arrives and discerns that Adora is likely to be of lost royal blood, as she can 'hear' dragon speech and magically heal others.Belora, daughter of Adora, is also working as a healer, and mated to two dragon knights - women being scarce, the men willingly share a partner. Warfare is now waged openly between the kingdoms, the dragons flaming the skiths, which spit back acidic venom, while diamond-tipped crossbow bolts capable of piercing dragon scales are suddenly brought into use by the Skithdrons. Darius, fearing that the evil magic he has witnessed is taking over King Lucan, decides to defect in order to warn Draconia, thereby putting himself into grave peril. Meanwhile Adora is the subject of a well-meaning conspiracy by the dragon Kelzy, who decides that the woman requires two dragon knight mates.This is part of a complex series but can be read as a standalone, with sympathetic characters and well-imagined medieval warfare. Be warned, it features threesomes in a loving relationship between three life partners. Bianca D'Arc has written several books in this and her other fantasy series. I enjoyed this exciting tale and will be looking out for more of her work.",Border Lair,1369180800,2,2,5,1
"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow, but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters, and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves, it sure has been a lost art in the western society!

"So here's Elise sitting in a bar, which she never does, having a few drinks alone, which she never does, all because her boyfriend text messaged her that he was calling off their relationship to go back to his wife, which she never knew he had in the first place. So many new experiences all in one day. The bartender asks if she wants another drink and Elise decides shes had enough. She needs to get home it's been a long day, but this big good looking guy with tattoos on his arms and piercings here and there sits down next to her and announces that she should have another drink anyway. She starts to decline and he insists convincing her to tell him why she has had such a long day. She can't understand it but she finds herself pretty attracted to him. He is absolutely NOT her type. She goes for guys in business suits. But after today she's thinking maybe she should try following a different track, besides he was definitely affecting her libido. No this wasn't happening . She'd just been dumped and was feeling vulnerable, but this guy was so gorgeous and hot So she told him what happened to her and he said ""Text message? You serious? Dumbass man."" That kind of wins her over to his way of thinking. Moving on quickly after a lot of talk and flirting the tattooed man says ""Let me take care of you."" Holy cow! She's not even his type. She knows that. He's definitely not hers. WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT! Ha! Ha! Gotta read the book to find out.Hot! Hot! Hot! read. Steamy, Flame blowing, Sweet and touching.

"Enjoyable, low key mystery. Plenty of murders but not too much violence (in the way they are handled). 60 year old, unemployed man, is caught  up in The Case of the Murdered Cheer Leaders. Along the way he comes into the orbit of one fellow high school student, from many years ago, who was still in the mood for love. He, himself, has also been warned that his efforts to help the remaining former students, will bring on him the same fate as was meted out to his female classmates. A warm, congenial book despite the grim subject matter, l found it quite pleasant. The hero is a good companion for the time it takes to read the story, so, too, is his  security guard buddy, and, even, most of the police on the case. The author writes well, the plot, though creaky is serviceable and the more relevant characters nicely sketched.

"I found this to be an ""odd"" story.  I am not quite sure what it was about it that didn't click with me, but whatever it was will not prevent me from reading the next in the series.  It was a good lead in to the series.  I liked Connor and Cassie.  I am hoping for a little more of an explanation of the ""world"" per say as the series continues so I can get a little more invested.  I love reading Cameron Dane so I can't wait to see where this series goes!  As far as the main characters go I think a lot of the denial on his part is because he feels like her guardian after her dad died, and that respect I think that intensified her feelings for him as she grew up for Connor.  I do think they are a perfect fit.  Their ups and downs to get together are to be expected.  This is a quick light read.",Good start to a series....it is a little different.......,1277251200,1,1,4,1
"I was stuck between the four and five star rating. It was a page-turner for me with enough action to keep me interested. I really enjoyed the characters and this has to be the most original story I have ever read. Which is what brought me to the five star rating.The one thing about this story that made the reading difficult for me were the names, most of which I could not understand let alone pronounce. I found myself replacing the names in my head so that I could read through but too often I got caught up trying to figure out some sort of pronunciation for them so I lost track of the story. And because of the incomprehensible names of all the Reapers, I couldn't find myself relating to them as individuals because I couldn't keep their names straight in my head.The only other issue I had with this story was with the ending. It was a long story with a lot of very different issues they dealt with, so I though that it really should have had a conclusion, allowing book two to start off with a different character and their own trials. Or at the very least, allow for one of the other Reaper's stories to take over book two but while working off the conclusion of book one. For instance, another Reaper could find his mate while in Haines City helping Cynyr and Aingeal with their battle. Although, I have only read the synopsis for book two, so maybe that did turn out to be the situation. But that didn't sound like the case in the description.Even with the above criticism I still managed to love the story. Go figure! It was the first I've been really excited about in a long time and had a difficult time putting it down. I would definitely recommend it. Just try to work out the names before you start. It will make the reading go smoother.",The most original story I have ever read...,1367798400,0,0,5,1

"When I started this book, I had the feeling to read one of my favorite old sweet romance. I confess, I was an avid reader of those old Harlequin Present series, above all the Long Tall Texan series by Diana Palmer. In those romance, the hero was always an handsome and wealthy Long Tall Texan rancher and the heroine was always some sweet virgin, and often it was some family friend's daughter, or a neighbor, or the foster child hosted on the ranch. A bit of age difference was requested, but not so much to be insurmountable. Usually the two lovers were aware of their feelings soon enough, but the wiser and older hero was reluctant to take advantage of someone he considered under his protection.The Convenient Husband is all of this. Tucker is the oldest son of a Texan rancher; he built his life far from the ranch, but he was often back home to visit, at least until Micah reached his 18 years old. Micah was the nephew of the ranch's foreman, and he has always lived on the ranch since 4 years old. And he was always the shadow of Tucker. But on his 18 years old birthday Micah was suddenly the forbidden fruit and Tucker surrendered to temptation. A night of passion, Micah still a virgin, was enough to make Tucker run away; as usually in this story, Tucker thinks he is doing Micah a favor, he is too old and bitter for a young thing like Micah. Problem is that Tucker doesn't realize that, in a isolated ranch in Texas, there are not so many chance of hapinnes for a gay boy like Micah.Four years later Micah needs Tucker to be back home: Tucker's grandfather is dying and he wants his nephew near him; plus the old man's will states that he will leave the ranch to the first of his nephews to marry... even if it's not a legal marriage in Texas. Being both Tucker than Micah gays, the obvious solution is for Tucker to marry Micah, so the young man will be able to remain forever on the ranch, and this time even as a real family member... But once Tucker tastes again the forbidden fruit, will he be able to walk away from him again?The story is mostly funny and it doesn't last long in the life of the two main characters, only few days, but there is a nice Epilogue that let you have a glimpse in their future life. It also avoids almost all the angst usually linked to a gay relationship in a ""unwelcoming"" setting, only one man has something to say against Tucker and Micah's relationship, and inside their home, all other people around are supporting and happy, like it was the only thing they were expecting. So there is no really trouble among Tucker and Micah, if not only a bit of stubbornness from both side, exactly like on those old sweet romance I loved so many years ago. The Convenient Husband is a modern tale with an old sweet feeling. The only bittersweet feeling I had was for Tucker's grandfather, even if he has not really any scenes, he seemed a very interesting man, and it was very sad to see him gone. Also the other old man of the story, Micah's uncle, Juan, reserves a nice surprise to the reader and even to Micah's himself, and in the epilogue, the author hints to a story that I would really like to read, a love story where one of the characters is 69 years old and the other one 35... a may december relationship with plus a silver romance in it... really something the author should consider to write.",His Convenient Husband by J.L.

I am also surprised at how much I enjoyed this, as alternate universe fiction with a science fiction theme is by no means a preferred genre of mine. This was a pleasant little read that I enjoyed very much, and while I can see how expanding this into a full-length novel would definitely appeal to the fans of the genre, I think it may have been a little too much for me to really enjoy.

"This is a story driven by the characters. Micah's deep ties to both the Delanys and their ranch are immediately evident. They are the closest thing he has to family and he will do whatever he can to protect them. His attitude is almost a perfect reflection of Tucker's attitude toward him and the ranch. Everything Tucker has done has been to protect his family and Micah. It is his idea of protecting Micah that has put the biggest wedge between the two of them and watching them overcome that is great. These two cannot be in the same room together without sparks flying, no matter who else is around, and they sizzle when alone. But it's not just the heat that will draw readers in, but the tenderness that comes with it.Nothing about this story will disappoint. And while Micah and Tucker are the focus of the story, the whole Delany family and Micah's uncle are important characters who enrich the story.

Then when she's walking out of the bathroom she runs straight into him and knocks off her glasses which makes her unable to see. To make the beginning more interesting, they have to hide together in an alcove to keep from being discovered by the mean girls who happen to rush out of the bathroom right behind the heroine.

Characterization is well developed and the writing style is good, with few editing errors.I'm not a Vampire fan, but I enjoy new twists on old concepts. This book is a great example of that.

"I'm a fairly new fan to dystopian fiction. In Haven by Justin Kemppainen ""No action is without consequence"". This couldn't be truer for Kaylee who is caught in the middle of a war that is brewing between the Citizens and Elijah, the slumlord king.In this post-apocalyptic nightmare, it is truly a struggle to survive unless you are a Citizen. If you are a Citizen you are well-fed, well-sheltered, well-clothed and healthy. To be a Citizen is to live separate from the filthy and downtrodden, the disease ridden and the poor. To not be a Citizen is to fight to survive. Danger lurks around every corner in many guises; murder, starvation, disease, exposure to elements and lack of basic necessities.The struggle between classes is reminiscent of times past and present; a different setting, certainly, but it smacks of the same prejudice that has always existed whether it be racial, social etc... of course, In Haven it is much more extreme.I like the way the author integrated it into the dystopian setting where people are starving, being kidnapped and `reprogrammed' in order to serve the elite.  It is a compelling book and very well written.I look forward to more works from Mr. Kemppainen. I'm not sure if there is a sequel in the works or not. If so, I'll definitely read it or anything else he writes.",Haven,1286236800,15,15,4,1

"Amsterdam 2012 is a story of a dystopian future (Similar to the 1980's TV series Amerika), only this time the invaders aren't communists but Muslim extremists. The heroine, Ann, is a generic college girl visiting Amsterdam when she and her boyfriend Peter, stumble across a violent murder commited by Islamic terrorists. They flee the country just before violence erupts in Europe. I found the story to be exciting and engaging, even if times I found Ann and Peter annoying as protagonists.First, Ann at times got under my skin. I never felt like she had much personality. I felt she was whiney, often complaining about her lack of privilege and moping around her house worrying about Peter. This woman is an adult, and yet it seemed like her parents baby her. During a time of serious crisis Ann gets resentful because she misses the college scene and the accompanying partying. She also spends far too much time pining for Peter. Doesn't she have other friends or boyfriends? Also she and her teen brother come to physical blows over something Alex said which just was odd.Peter himself was a bit of a cipher. Portrayed as sort of disinterested and boring during their Amsterdam trip, (for reasons which are later revealed), I never felt any concern for him or could quite see what Ann could see in him. Ann's constant comparison of herself to Anne Frank also seemed a bit... Insensitive, as Ann never has it half as bad as Frank did.There are some typos and stuff which could've been edited out. For instance there is a time when the author juxtaposes' her brother Alex's name for Peter's and it comes out weird, especially since it is a scene where Peter is kissing her fingertips but it is written like Alex did it.Even with this criticism, I enjoyed Amsterdam 2012.

They were so much a part of each others lives I could understand how Mav could overlook his real feelings for Duke. I liked that though they each had confusion and conflict in the relationship there were no outside influence in the form of other potential lovers. They dealt with their problems one on one and Mav wasn't so stubborn that he refused to reconsider his position on the relationship to the point that the friendship was destroyed. The ending was very satisfying. They discovered that the unknown is often more frightening than the reality. A truly great read.,A Great Read,1379289600,1,1,5,1

"A DANCE IN THE DARK is a touching novella of the transformative and redemptive ability of love when we allow ourselves to look beyond outward appearances.I was immediately drawn in from the moment Louisa entered the cave.  Like a moth to the flame Louisa and Douglas are drawn to each other despite numerous reasons against their friendship.  Louisa is an extremely rich heiress who has inherited every unfortunate facial feature in her family.  She believes she looks as much like a horse as is humanly possible.  None of her suitors can see past the face to the person and beauty beneath; to her honesty, fairness, intelligence, and compassion.  They pursue only her fortune.  It shouldn't still hurt but it does and keeps her separate from everything and everyone, an outcast.Douglas is voluntarily an outcast and hermit when Louisa stumbles upon him in the hidden cave.  Douglas is also a vampire.  Not the traditional blood sucking variety either.  Really interesting and I've only read a few like him.  He can ""read"" Louisa's thoughts and know her inner self.  All her beautiful qualities are revealed to and cherished by him for their rarity.  For her part Douglas is always hidden in shadow so Louisa knows nothing of his looks, only what he reveals through actions and words.  Together Louisa and Douglas discover friendship that blossoms to more even as Douglas tries to shove her away.The difference between how we see ourselves and how we look to another when viewed through the eyes of love is the center of this wonderful story.

This is teen fiction, but it held my attention all the way through.Obviously the negative reviewers were expecting more. For them I suggest Henry James.Surviving the Fog is very close to Swiss Family Robinson and it's a fun read in the same way. True, there's no plot, just a sequence of incidents. Yes, female characters seem to be cardboard stage props. Yes, the last quarter of the book wanders. Yes, it could use more proofing -- although I only noticed 3 errors.

"That's it just 41 pages. The stories are good and I wanted more the only problem is that it was not there. Well for 99 cents do I really have the right to complain. I think not. Some of the stories were a bit simplistic like the first one where he Malik Ibn Ibrahim meets Quin, a hardened chick bounty hunter. After Malik surprises her at the scene of the murder they strike up a friendship that seems all to quick for the purpose of taking down a charming serial killer. I would expect a bit more resistance on Quinn's part after meeting a Djinn with all it's powers I think she would want to get the you know out of there. Over all it was a good story. They finally bring down the killers guardian Jaffur, a troublesome Ifrit in a game of wits. Everyone gets their just deserts. The story was still entertaining.Malik Ibn Ibrahim is one of those Djinn who thinks well of the human race and tries to help out when he can. The second story involves a troubled teen ager who gets into fights. His temper rages further and further out of control in each successive day. Seems that he is controlled by other Djinn and it is up to Malik to save the day for this troubled youth. In the third story he is conjured by professor Freeman quite against his will. Rather then be angry Malik offers some insight into the future healing of professor Freeman's son.The last story involves a battle for a  sword.

"Cynthia `Cyn' Elder manages The Glass Slipper where she spends more than her fair share of time covering her father's lover's daughters Drew and Staci's shifts because he requested that she hire them.  To make matters worse, the lazy irresponsible gruesome twosome are living at her apartment - also as a favor to her dad.  She might have continued indefinitely with this dissatisfying life but her friends MeShell and Miller's insistence on her attending the grand opening of a night club.Parker Maguire, AKA the ""Prince of Hollywood"" or ""Movie Midas,"" was looking to venture into something fun outside of Hollywood when he agreed to invest in DelRay's new nightclub.  Right away he realizes that his idea of partying and the racket going on are totally different.  The last thing he expects is for his attempt at getting a little fresh air to lead him to an enchanting young woman who isn't intimidated by his reputation or wealth.Cyn and Parker meet through odd circumstances.  She was in the middle of a heated argument with one of the club bouncers - and in Parker's opinion holding her own against the muscle bound hulk.  Parker intercedes and invites Cyn to join him in the VIP room and proceeds to enjoy a stimulating conversation with her all the while loving the fact that she's either clueless about his fame or simply doesn't care about it.  Parker's determined that Cyn is the woman he wants to share his life with and Cyn who's never considered dating white men is rethinking her `policy.'  Before they can truly get to know each other or exchange information, Cyn receives a call from Miller and has to go see to her friend.  He's run across his ex lover and is very upset.  MeShell and his love of cross dressing annoys Miller but he still sticks around to make sure that Miller is okay and get the goods on where Cyn had disappeared to at the nightclub.  Cyn doesn't discover that Parker is so well known until MeShell hands her a magazine with his picture on the cover.  Dare she dream of a happily ever after with her own `Prince?'You'll fall HEAD OVER HEELS for this modern day Cinderella story.  Lena Matthews had me chuckling my way through this quick witted and charming story.  While Cyn and Parker's story is captivating and kept me eagerly reading to find out what would happen between them.  It was the secondary characters, MeShell and Miller that I absolutely adored.  MeShell's vivacious nature and Miller's down to earth serious personality seem to clash yet there's a bond between them that is prevalent throughout the story.  They're the most unlikely of `fairy god mothers' but they do it with such style that as a reader I had to cheer them and their friendship with Cyn.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",You'll fall HEAD OVER HEELS for this modern day Cinderella story.,1236643200,17,17,5,1

"My Review by Carlyn - BMR Guest ReviewerLark has been in love with her cousin Taran for years. Don't worry they are cousins only by a late marriage so no ick factor! What she doesn't know is that she is actually the alpha wolf, Taran's, mate. He has been keeping his feelings and his mating instinct a secret because he thinks she will reject him because they are family. When Lark becomes in danger after inadvertently becoming involved in one of Taran's police investigations he must protect her and his own heart.In this world, werewolf's are a known species so there was no big species shocker for Lark which made the storyline flow with ease. I really liked the characters in this story. Taran is still a gruff and bossy alpha wolf but he still has a sense of humor and you can understand why he kept his feelings from Lark. Lark is absolutely hilarious and she loves teasing Taran. She is also not afraid to go after what she wants when she puts her mind to it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves shifters, romance and some red hot love scenes!

"Darkest Fire, available so far only as an e-book, is a short story that is a prequel to the Lords of the Underworld series but it is completely standalone, no Dark possessed Lords here.  Instead it is the story of the origins of the box which originally imprisoned the demons before being intrusted to Pandora.  It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world. It very much has the same type of feel as P.C. Cast's Goddess of the Rose with the romance between a creature that sees himself as so ugly that doesn't dare to hope that the beauteous object of his affection could see beyond his skin to his noble heart, it also has a similar type of bittersweet happily ever after. I thought that this was a nice little tease to the series before it hit the bookstores, and now that the books are out it's a brief 'just so' historical note to the series, since the box is what got all the Lords into an eternity of trouble.

As a silent partner for the club, Parker Maguire wanted to see the fruits of his investment but soon met a fiery and sassy Cyn having words with his bouncer. Their priorities shifted as Cyn and Parker got to know each other but there was a threat to their relationship in the form of two lazy daughters of her dad's girlfriend who were plotting the demise of this new relationship.A Cinderella Story had all the ingredients of the original version but came to life into a twenty first century happy ever after fairy tale.

In reading the story, I liked the fact that my mind was busy piecing together and waiting in anticipation of what scene was coming up next or how it was portrayed.NellieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Head over Heals,1234137600,6,6,5,1
"I've been reading Dane's books for a couple of years now and just when I think I've read everything she's written I stumble on rare little gems like this story. I loved Caitlin and Eamon's love journey and who can resist a hot Irishman! I would've loved a little revenge scene with her ex but that's just my petty bitchiness coming out. I did wonder a bit about Caitlin's sad friend Amy and her love troubles and it even seemed like it might've been a spin-off to another story.

"Marion Stein's Loisaida - A New York Story was one of my favourite novels of last year - The Death Trip is a novella and a very different beast to it's predecessor.The Death Trip is a more tightly focussed story than the cast-of-thousands Loisaida and unlike that book's unflinching realism and period detail (being set in the 80s Lower East Side) it introduces an sci-fi almost metaphoric element - the titular Death Trip. This is a new drug that is used to ease the suffering of terminally ill patients - by taking it they enter an unconscious state that feels like years spent living in their own version of paradise, but in fact takes place in minutes before the person dies.The central character is investigating the drug and the corporation that manufacturers and administers it, and Stein uses the drugs existence as a starting point to throw lots of ideas it the mix.  And this is very much a novel of ideas, and if the thought of characters debating ethics and ideas puts you off a book then this isn't for you (although there's plenty of intrigue, spot on characterisation, and even some romance too). Stein creates a pleasant moral ambiguity around proceedings - the question of whether The Death Trip drug really is a miracle or something sinister is left tantalisingly unclear. As such this is a book that requires some intellectual investment from the reader - I was reading this whilst the Tony Nicklinson right to die debate was in the press, and that very much coloured my response.Fortunately whilst it might be up in the air about whether The Death Trip drug is good or bad, there's no such debate needed about whether The Death Trip book is good or not - it's another great read. And it's free - what more do you need?",Take The Death Trip,1342656000,2,2,4,1

"This collection of H. Beam Piper is a very good representation of the man's work. My only complaints are 1) The monospace type is a bit distracting, and 2) I have to echo another reviewer in that it is difficult to navigate around books already read because there is no index that will allow you to go quickly to selected pieces. But heck, for the price, I guess it's worth it. Second hand book sellers are asking three times Amazon's price for just ""Junkyard Planet"" or retitled as ""The Cosmic Computer"". I recommend Piper as a nice easy read that is not real heavy on the science and more on characters.",A Bit Cumbersome in the way it's presented,1294099200,3,3,4,1

"This story followsEye of the Beholder- the two stories do stand alone, but it is more interesting to read about Neil here when you know about his past.Neil is a changed man, but most people still see him as the selfish man he used to be. The story gets off to a dramatic start when Sarah is forced to accept the hospitality of a man she believes to be a monster. As her troubles mount and she receives cold responses elsewhere, she comes to recognise that Neil is very different from his reputation in town. He is devoted to his daughter Emily and shows her and her baby nothing but kindness.The romance between them is slow and based on friendship initially. Their growing bond is very warm and realistic.They face several obstacles - from people interfering in her life and others in his and Emily's.I enjoyed this book, but not quite as much as the previous Eye of the Beholder. I felt that the ending scene in town was slightly farcical and unrealistic, but all's well that ends well.This book introduces us to Eliza, whose story is told inLoving Eliza- another very enjoyable book by Ruth Ann Nordin",New hope,1300665600,1,1,4,1

When I downloaded this book I was expecting the usual Young Adult fantasy story.  And in fact it started off that way.  But I realized that the relatively slow pace of time through the book meant that the author was planning quite a long epic story. And I love epic fantasy books. So I enjoyed that this first book just barely started the story.  We lived through the childhood years in which Jahrra behaves rather like a typical child with all the immature decision making that goes along with it. However we begin to see the bigger picture little by little through the stories she's told. And we see signs of the person she's going to grow up to be. So many books these days try to cram far too much into a single book. I really like the fact that it's going to take a few of them to tell the whole story.  It's true that there isn't a whole lot of action in this book but there was plenty for me.  I immediately bought book 2 and read it upon finishing this one.,Delightful,1297555200,1,1,5,1

Carrying his burdens from the past, Dove sets out to investigate the murder of his friend, a grocer at the Mountain Store.  As the scene of the murder unfolds, we meet Tessa, a beautiful well-known model, with an unusual past and a connection to the murder.The author takes the reader on a vivid, detailed journey where the sheriff is searching for two killers and a woman on the run.  Nothing is as it seems as layer after layer unfolds.  I found myself pausing and re-reading in order to absorb the depths of all the characters.  This is a fast paced read, but don't go too fast as you will miss some of the clues!This is an outstanding well written book that kept me ""on my toes"" and gave me much food for thought!

"Delaney scores with Book One of the Phoenix Rebellion, ""Revolution."" Set in the near future, Delaney puts together an ensemble cast of characters and pits them against the Areth for the survival of the human race.The Areth come from outer space and appear human. They've come to Earth and shared medical technology with us, but little else. A group of humans, ""The Phoenix Rebellion,"" believe the Areth do not have peaceful intentions toward the human race. Covertly, a member of the Rebellion, Dr. Caitlin Montgomery, infiltrates the Areth's medical complex in New Mexico. Caitlin learns that an Areth scientist, Kathleen, gave birth to a half-human, half-Areth child, Michael. Michael's father is a human, Col. Nick Tanner. Caitlin finds Nick in Maine and shares the information with him. He's stunned. He thought his wife and son had died in childbirth. Without a second thought, Tanner joins the Rebellion, despite the fact that his feelings for Caitlin are complicated due to their previous affair which ended badly.Nick finds General Castleton in Colorado and meets other members of the Rebellion - a married couple, Lilly, who is a doctor and her pilot husband, Jace. There's also an empath, Dr. Beverly Surimoto. After a carefully coordinated plan, the Rebellion attack the Areth's complex in New Mexico, hoping to free the Areth's subjects - including Michael. An Areth scientist, Victor, has befriended Michael and helps the Rebellion. All is not well with Victor though, as he begins having a mental breakdown. The escape from the Areth's complex in New Mexico is a thrill ride, but one of the Rebellion loses his life and the fate of the human race hangs precariously in the balance.Delaney's writing is sharp. After a quick introduction to the Areth, Delaney jumps into the story. The plot flows well, never lingering. Delaney uses a good economy of words to paint descriptions. It's easy for the reader to visualize her futuristic world.Delaney's characters are what makes this science fiction story shine. Col. Nick Tanner is a passionate man who has been hurt deeply in the past. Learning to trust Caitlin again is a struggle. Caitlin, for her part, realizes the folly of her youth, and tries to make up for it. The couple's chemistry is on a slow, smoldering burn that threatens to consume both when ignited. Victor's plight is heartbreaking, especially since he's an alien who shows Michael compassion. Michael's condition is intriguing. It's never fully explored in this book, leaving the reader wanting to discover more about him.The story is ""sophisticated"" for romance readers. Delaney's love scenes are intense, yet tasteful. Book One: Revolution is a story packed with adventure, excitement, and love, making it a thrilling start to ""The Phoenix Rebellion"" series.",The Phoenix Rebellion Scores!,1269302400,3,3,5,1

"Awesome awesome book! Just what I've come to expect from Scott Nicholson.I have this habit of trying to picture different scenarios in my head as I'm reading to see where an author is going with the storyline.  Then I get my aha! I thought that was going to happen somewhere down the road.I had no idea where Scott was going when I started this and I couldn't figure it out until I read it when I got to that point in the story.  I hope Scott takes this as a complement when I say this book was so strange, but a great strange.  I knew there was something going on with the food because Roby was fixated with food, but I never would have guessed what actually was behind the food.  This was one of those, keep turning the page (or clicking the next button on my Kindle), don't put it down until you're done type of books.This book starts out at the sitting for Jacob Ridgehorn and continues on through the viewing and the funeral.  All of it revolving around Roby and the food and his thoughts on proper funeral procedure, which was actually kind of interesting.  Tell me you haven't done it?  Been in a somber situation, not able to believe the behavior of some who are there?  He does give them leeway in his mind because they are grieving.He sits through the bickering and manages to get everyone to eat the pie.  What's in the pie?  I can't tell you.  You will never ever think of it yourself though.I said this in my review of The Red Church, but I'll say it again. Scott Nicholson reminds me of some of the greats, Stephen King, Dean R Koontz, etc.  This reminded me of some of Stephen King's shorter story.  Not in the writing style, because that is all Scott's wonderful style, but in the suspense category.  His stories are full of so much detail, you can easily picture it in your head, you can smell the food, see the congealed grease around the ham, the marshmallows on the sweet potato pie (I'm never eating pie at a funeral again, thank you very much Scott. :) ) This is just another great read from Scott Nicholson.Thank you Scott!",Another Suspenseful Awesome Read from Scott!,1266796800,36,36,5,1

"As a lifelong Christian (I was raised in a Christian home, was saved at 8 yrs old, never known a time in my life where I didn't know Jesus) I've experienced some very hurtful things in churches in the past. The church I was saved in had a business meeting in order to fire one of the pastors. My parents supported all the pastors but we were in the minority. The meeting became very heated until finally we had to run out of the sanctuary. People became ugly fast and chased us, even shooting a gun into the air in the church sanctuary. They literally ran us out of town. We moved and my parents joined the First Baptist Church but didn't attend church very much and finally not at all. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ but they lost faith in the church (and my Mom was the daughter of a minister). As a teenager, I began attending a small church with some friends but the older people of the congregation resented being overrun with teenagers. It disrupted their placid spiritual life so they fired the preacher and all the teens left that church. My husband and I joined a church in 1983 and attended until 2009. We were very active. But of all the pastors that went through our church, I could probably count on one hand the ones that didn't abuse the congregation in one way or another. Finally, we had a straw-that-broke-the-camels'-back event and we left our church. Needless to say I'm gun shy now! We've been visiting churches all over our town but haven't found a match yet. I think I might like one but only to get anxious that we would invest our time, money and selves into a body that has the same problems. It takes awhile before you get to know the church, policies, leadership, congregants enough to know if all is well or something is rotten in Denmark. I had almost made up my mind to be like my parents and just drop out of the church scene and worship God in my own way. Then I read this book. I think the book's description is right on the mark so I won't repeat it. But, since I started reading this book, we've started visiting more churches and praying that we find one soon.",Why the church?,1360195200,1,1,4,1

"A pregnant mother and her thirteen-year-old son flee an abusive home to find shelter in anonymity. Fate leads them to the small village of the boy's deceased father and a flat provided by the housing council. When they find ominous messages scribbled beneath peeling wallpaper they make their first chore in the new home a paint-over of the walls. But the messages put fear into the boy while a unique cane carried by the lady from the council disquiets his mom. With that foreshadowing the author cleverly sets up a climate of foreboding that lets the reader know more dire circumstances will follow.The excerpt sadly ends here, but the synopsis of Coombe's Wood promises that there are secrets in the adjacent woods.

"""Mistress to the Beast"" is a take on ""Beauty and the Beast..."" the plot has been summarized in other reviews, but I didn't read them, so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like, but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt, and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth, but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY, was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage, it is so refreshing to see a Black female called ""beautiful-"" not ""beautiful for a Black woman."" Neither character gave much attention to race, and their hang-ups were human, without the racial drama.

"I've enjoyed this blog a lot on my Kindle. It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material. Tuesday has a shot at an article or two if the Thursday entry is small. Wednesday will be there. It's just not much fun to not be able to read old posts.Oh it does not feed to iPhone.So this blog is free. Well how can anybody really complain? I'm an almost daily reader now.Apparently this blog is somewhere on Amazon, my best efforts to search for it could not find it. The only way I could get to it was to use google with the search term amazon daily. Sad that I had to go all the way out there to find this nice blog.I think you can type in this: amazon dot com slash gp slash daily.","Good Tech, Movie, Television, Toys, and Book Mix",1238803200,6,6,4,1

She knew she needed a place to stay to get out of the storm so she found a house that she thought was abandoned. She quickly found out the house belonged Braedan that was serving time. Most people thought he was serving time for a crime he didn't commit. She wanted to be out of the house before he got out of jail.  He got out early, and came home to the smell of apple pie, and a beautiful lady in his kitchen. It was sweet at how fast the two fell in love with one another.Some of my best parts from the book:Sample from chapter 3 - As the water washed over her, she wondered how she'd gotten herself into this mess. She was engaged to an ex-con, a man she'd never met before last night: she was on the run for murder and she was absolutely terrified.Sample from chapter 4""You would have been better off if I hadn't come here."" He put his fork down and turned her to face him. ""Don't ever think that. You took my house and made it into a home, Ainsley.

"Elizabeth Reed's life had come full circle.  She was now living in her home town trying to put her life back together after a hideous divorce.  All she wanted to do was make some kind of life for herself and daughter Angie.  She wasn't sure this was the best move considering the two first loves of her life were still living close, but she was out of choices.  Years ago, they had broken her heart, and told her the thoughts she had of them all being together were ludicrous.  Lizzy just had to concentrate on what was important - finding a job and taking care of her daughter.  Anything else was just a foolish girls dream.Hayden and Chandler Scott had waited what seemed like forever for Lizzy to return to them.  The moment they had heard of her divorce, they impatiently waited for the moment they could claim her.  The brothers couldn't believe they had made the colossal mistake of turning her away when she laid her heart on the line.  She had fled all she loved when they had turned her away.  Now it was a matter of getting her to forgive them.I have really enjoyed the books in this series.  LB has a special way of incorporating steamy elements and emotional content into a truly engaging story.  I loved Elizabeth and the strength of her character.  In times of trial, she digs deep relying on herself to find a solution to problems.  She isn't above asking for help when needed, but knows she can stand on her own if she has to.  When you toss in two gorgeous men who want nothing other than to make Lizzy happy, you end up with a must read.",Dakota Springs,1280793600,1,1,4,1
"Chloe Maitland is a very hard working young woman who tries desperately to save the house she inherited from her father from foreclosure. Except for the mortgage on the house, her father left her a smithy behind the house but Chloe can't work the shop by herself, neither can she find a blacksmith in the small town she has been living all her life, which is past the gold fever and in a desolate economic condition. Chloe advertised in a local paper for a blacksmith but nobody showed up since she can't offer anything else besides board and lodging.  Every day that passes increases her despair until one day a stranger arrives in her yard and breaks down  with a heat stroke - he read the add and applies for the position but right now he isn't in any position to help Chloe. Anyway, she patches him up and although she doesn't really want to hire him she sees no way out and Travis McGuire starts working for her. However, the coexistence between Travis and Chloe is anything but peaceful: she's strong-minded and bullheaded, he's insulting and relentless and the sparks fly!What a wonderful story! The plot started out a bit slow but was then elaborated into a beautiful love story that offered successful as well as entertaining twists and turns.Chloe was a wonderful heroine. Life sure wasn't nice to her and she tried to shield herself from further pain by raising an emotional wall around herself.  However, when she finally finds love she is willing to begin a new life even if this new start would offer her even less than she had until now in terms of belongings and securities.Travis was a very complex character who also suffered a lot during his life.  It was very interesting to observe that his initial ""disliking"" of Chloe's appearance and attitude changed into love and that he would have sacrificed his life for Chloe's safety. Absolutely adorable!By the way: there was a villain who was interesting  personality and somewhere a bounty hunter was involved and played a major role in the development of the plot.An absolutely recommendable book about real love and second chances in life!",Very interesting!,1322956800,0,0,5,1
"Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg, Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony. He's Cal's best man, but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do, exactly. He's pretty sure he's not supposed to punch his brother, but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin. It's not that Pete begrudges his brother's happiness, but Pete's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over...to the point that he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. Staying away from his email and voicemail while he's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort, and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check. Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned, Janie Dupree's life would be a lot less complicated. Unfortunately, everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help. Not to mention, he's rude. Cute though. But Janie's seeing someone...sort of...even if he is boring and self-involved. And then there's The Wedding, which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax, and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role, Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them. Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com, I've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg, Texas, and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author. With a smooth, crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves, Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands. As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans, I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is, and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia, but still they were a pleasure to read about. I don't think Pete's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal's had been in his, so the evolution of Pete's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle, but I enjoyed the results all the same. The Wedding is a good foil for the book, though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book. What it provided, however, was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic. With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy, a mother who disapproves of everything and anything, and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive, Pete's family was pretty much nightmarish. I didn't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law, but thought it was great storytelling. Janie's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice didn't serve her very well, but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance, I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it's taking. I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together, and for my personal preferences, the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame, right up until the end. There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous, but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story, and just a touch more charming because of it, but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion, was more realistic with an overall better plot. I've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby: Konigsburg, Texas, Book 3.

"I love Ms. Sutton's writing! Her stories dig deep into the inner soul of her characters and deal with issues and feelings and longings that are common to us all, but ones which the typical Christian novel does not deal with. Where other novels gloss over our inner urgings, Ms. Sutton faces them head on without fear. I would say this particular story deals with lust vs. love. What is the difference? What does God say about this? He created our attractions, after all. They are not inherently evil. But what do we do with them? How can we harness them in a world where no one seems to?  Although there is alot of sexual innuendos in this book, there has to be in order to get the points Ms. Sutton wishes to get across. The characters are real and likeable and we really feel for them.  Let's face it, all of us have been in similar situations. Some of us have fallen. Others have overcome.Ms. Sutton's writing is crisp, simple, and clear and makes for an enjoyable, fast read. Personally, I would recommend this book to anyone, even as young as 12. My reason? They are going to face these issues in school and with their peer. Why not face them in a story where the characters make the right choices and God is glorified.

I felt the the surrealness, panic, excitement, and sadness that Dr. Leale felt.  This of course is a story from the surgeon's point of view.",great historical pov from the attending dr,1393027200,0,0,5,1
"I have only read the first book in the Peacekeepers series, so my impressions are not colored by whatever happens subsequently.  When I read The Birth a while back, I was not able to figure out where the author wanted to go.  He spent a lot of time talking about survival tips, which presumes that one is fortunate enough to survive a natural (or is it unnatural?) disaster.  For example, you can have a building collapse on an individual, and all the survivalist knowledge in that person's head is useless if he or she can't get free of the rubble.That being said, the book picks up steam once the main character starts moving across the post-apocalyptic America.  The author offers an interesting view of what happens when law and order breaks down in society.The Birth of the Peacekeepers offer a ton of action, and some introspection.  And at a bargain price of 99 cents for the Kindle version, this book is worth every penny.",A Solid Start,1325203200,0,0,4,1
"I have read most of Ms. Stacey's book and I have to agree with another reviewer, the heat was turned on on this one, with the explicit language and steamy scenes.  But overall, it worked well into the story.  Story begins when Jill is having a rough day after finding out she was not going to get a promotion she worked so hard to get.  Everything seemed to be going downhill from there on.  She hits someone's car, her groceries fall all over the place, she manages to insult her new boss and to top it off, she is attracted to her new boss' son Ethan.  Ethan thought Jill was super hot, but the moment she opened her mouth, she reminded him of his ex wife too much. After a small altercation at a parking lot with Ethan, she decides to quit her job.Jill has issues, especially with her family always making fun of her and telling her she doesn't face her problems and runs away.  Ethan was a good guy that turned bitter after his exwife left him and took everything he had.  They were both opposites, but the attraction between them was incredible.  They somehow find each other again stuck traveling together with a group of elderly folks on their way to Orlando.  So many things happen to them during the trip which brings them closer together.Story was humorous, enjoyable and kept you interested.  The banter between the characters was super funny and entertaining.  This book will keep you hooked.  You can slowly begin to see when these two characters begin to fall in love.  The love scenes were steamy and in my opinion, enhanced the storyline.  Characters were well developed, considering the length of the book.

"Judith Ivie has had a twenty-five plus career writing and editing. As a Connecticut native, she sets her latest Kate Lawrence mystery in Hartford and Wethersfield. She has an eager audience on the East Coast. A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is her third Kate Lawrence mystery, and she has published three non-fiction books.Kate Lawrence is undergoing several lifestyle changes at once: her long-time love, Armando, is moving in with her; her daughter is stretching her wings and has a new boyfriend; and her son is incommunicado with new exploits. To add to this, a telephone call from a couple of elderly spinsters who live in a grand old historic mansion reveals an actual skeleton in a closet that has been bricked up for forty some years. Kate is in the real estate business with a couple of lively women partners, and they rush over to be of assistance to the confused little old ladies. But by the time Kate rushes to their aid, the body has disappeared:""A pile of old bricks, mortar, splintered wood and other debris attested to the recent demolition of a narrow section of wall at the back of a closet next to a huge, ancient furnace. The new opening revealed a narrow space. John's flashlight shone on the pipes leading to the ancient boiler, one of which was leaking visibly. On the floor at the rear of the closet next to the pipes lay something that looked like a rag along with more bits of mortar and brick. I thought the cloth was dark blue, but I couldn't be certain. Except for some shelving filled with books and files along the back wall of the closet-like space, it was empty. I blinked and looked again. No body, no bones, nothing.""A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is a delightful cozy mystery, New England style. One can almost imagine Kate Lawrence as a younger version of Jessica Fletcher. Her fiery romance with the elegant Armando contributes romance, and her friends and fellow realtors provide glamour and humor. Kate is undergoing a midlife crisis of sorts, which actually grounds her and provides the reader with a glimpse of a middle-aged adventurer. The police appear at appropriate intervals, and life issues pop up to make this a densely packed little read that is both light and entertaining.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer",A densely packed little read that is both light and entertaining,1247184000,19,19,5,1

When her ex-boyfriend continues stalking her and making her life hell, Scott volunteers to take her mind off of her troubles.Tara Patrick wants her best friend's brother in the worst way.  However, she can't ask him to risk himself making sure she is safe from her unstable ex-boyfriend.  While Scott's blindness doesn't bother Tara in the least, she refuses to allow him to be in danger.Tara doesn't realize Scott's tenacity in taking care of someone he loves - especially if that someone is her.I have craved Scott's story since Annmarie McKenna first released Blackmailed.

"For many years, Meli Galdes serves as her family's ""unofficial"" assassin, and she is a very good one at that. Her family's last assignment for her was to do away with Celino Carvanna, the man who has hurt her in the past.When Celino saw her, he didn't remember her from the awkward girl he knew from before. All he was aware of was being captivated by her, and he would do anything to possess her.I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did.Though Ilona Andrews introduced a new world in this short read, the setting wasn't hard to understand, perhaps because it was patterned after the Mafia of our world, but it's more than that. The author gave just the right amount of description in order to help the readers understand the Kinsmen world, and she did it without info dumping or sounding tedious.I also like her characters, especially Meli who is the quintessential strong woman, and who rose from the ashes of her vulnerability and past pain without turning hard, enabling me to sympathize with her. I like that Meli didn't immediately fly into Celino's arms when he declared his feelings for her, as had happened in so many books I have read in the past. To the end, Meli was her own woman, forged in the fire of her experiences and the situations life--or people--has dealt her. I have long wanted to read a heroine who's strong like Meli and this story didn't disappoint. I was expecting a twist, but when it came, I was still caught by surprise. It was brilliant and oh-so-right for this story. Get this book, and you won't be sorry. Suffice it to say, I'm looking forward to more books in the Kinsmen world.",Thoroughly enjoyable!,1286064000,0,0,5,1

"I gotta tell you that I first heard about this series of books a few years back and was not at all interested and then I fell face first into ""the end of the world as we know it"" when I became a fan of Glenn Beck and took off my blinders and really saw what is happening to this country and to our so called civilized world.  As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read.  The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed.  The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow.  Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other.

"Sam and Lloyd, a couple of 11 year olds, hitch a ride in a stranger's car only to realize that it was the single greatest mistake of their young lives. They are taken to a big, old and creepy mansion and locked up separately. From the very beginning, one thing is clear to both the boys - the man had kidnapped them with cruel intentions. What will happen to them and how will they - if they do manage it - escape from the clutches of their kidnapper? How do they both deal with the situation?This is an amazingly gripping thriller. It gets so creepy at times that I had to look up a few times just to make sure that I was at the comfort of my own home and not stuck with those two 11 year olds! Yeah, I know that's weird, but true!! The sense of fear that appears in Sam and Lloyd once they realize that they had made a mistake in getting into a stranger's car, actually manages to settle into the reader. It is mainly because of the author's amazing narration and nothing else. Even though she doesn't give much time in building up the characters, as a reader you start to feel for the kids. Also, Ms.Savita's vivid description of every little detail helps us get into the comfortable feeling of knowing the surroundings of wherever the story takes us. The best (or the worst) part is that she actually doesn't tell us directly about the way the boys are treated. There are just hints here and there for us to pick up and then imagine the worst scenarios!! The two characters Sam and Lloyd seem to be very different from each other. While in danger, when Lloyd freezes, Sam is the one to jump into action. While we can applaud Sam's bravery, we cannot really blame Lloyd for being scared to do anything - he is after all an eleven year old.The book can also serve as a lesson to kids about how important it is to remain vigilant at all times. The world is after all full of people who can and do hurt children in all sorts of unimaginable ways. I would recommend it to all mature readers.",4.5 Stars. A Spine Chilling Novel,1338854400,0,0,5,1

"This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose. Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that. To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need.",How to train your brain,1354579200,5,5,5,1
"I have always enjoyed every piece of work I've read by Dana Marie Bell.  This one is no difference, but I did struggle a bit which is nor normal.The characters were complex, changing names during different times, with several conflicts existing simultaneously.The world was confusing at Tim's, simply from the fact that there were apparent vast differences in time between.The characters were well developed and it's a creative story, without a doubt.  I simply struggled a bit throughout the story, having to frequently remind myself who was who and what their conflict was.Maybe it's just me...but the struggles I had with the complexity definitely removed a bit of the enjoyment for me because I had to spend so much time rehashing the past in my mind, in order to put together the current.Other than that, it was q very creative story and well structured - just complex.  I have purchased the entire True Destiny Series, as I write this there are four in total, so I will be curious to see if the coming one's are as complex.

"Author Steve Peek has managed to straddle two worlds, bring his characters through the veils that separate them and still maintain a shroud of mystery around his tale, Longclaws. Are they from the realm we refer to as Hell? Are they behind the legends of the vampire? Are they going to cause me to sleep with the lights on for a while?Longclaws are predators with super-human strength, speed and bravery in their world, where survival is a constant battle. Each member of the clan has an important role to play, vital to their survival, yet, we do not meet them as individuals because that seems unimportant, they are what and who they are, able to see the big picture in the battle for survival, fiercely loyal to their clan and their traditions. When one Leader finds a way to cross the veils that surround their world from ours, it is to survive. Humans are unknown demons to them, weak, yet with the will to survive that is respected by the longclaws. If not for their passing through these veils or ley lines a young boy would never know how to belong to a family, how to feel loved, or how to find self-respect. I wondered if there was a villain in this tale. I saw factions fighting for survival in the only way they knew how!Steve Peek's writing style is almost dreamlike, blending Indian folklore, ley lines, myths and legends into a tale that will stay with you, in a hauntingly beautiful way. He grounds his tale with humanity at its finest, everyday people coping with the impossible, often mirroring the clan's will for survival, but who will win in the end?On a personal note, I absolutely loved the writing, the plot, the characters, the style, the pace and the world-building....my anticipated nightmares, not so much.",An ABSOLUTE Must Read!

That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.

"Often when we were young we fell in love with an older sibling's friend. More often than not they did not know we exist let alone realize our feelings about them.  This was the case with Sukie O'Leary, her brother Sean's friend Eamon Houlihan was that teenage crush, and hew was now ranked as one of the best goalies in the National Hockey League. What she didn't know is that Eamon had noticed years ago her growing up and the feelings were mutual.They all still had connections to the old neighborhood that they grew up in, in more ways than one would think.  The boys had been successful in both athletics in high school being able to further on their education by going to Ivy League Schools. Sean was now a successful Trauma Specialist and ER Doctor.  Eamon of course with hockey.  Sukie was being talked about as well now because she had ""cancer"" and that was something everyone whispered about behind her back and looked at her differently.  Which she hated, she wanted people to just treat her like they did before.  While Eamon had wanted to rush back and help when he heard the news earlier, he waited but he did vow to treat her normally.  But he didn't know just what he was getting himself into.Practice makes you perfect is something that we have all heard, well Sukie felt she was out of practice in bed and needed someone to help her, that person was Eamon on the condition no strings attached.  Little did they realize that there were strings and the heat they created with each other was enough to melt the ice rink that Eamon played on. An accident on the ice made them realize how much they did need each other.It was a good short story and did remind us that if you do know someone who has been affected by an illness they do want to be treated normally.  I do hope that the author comes back with a story on Sean because he sounds like an interesting man himself.",Will the ice help cool down this romance?,1325980800,1,1,4,1

"After a worldwide economic crash, everybody is living in a lawless world where it's every man for himself to defend and survive.  Selena has been on her own for a few years after the death of her parents.  The effects of society and her environment dominate and distort her entire life including her relationships with other people.  She is distrustful of others with good cause, and she survives by avoiding and hiding from them.  While running away from a group of men who meant to harm her, Dan saves her, and Selena is taken unwillingly to Dan's small community hidden by trees and craters.  The community seems to be living in harmony and the people pooled their talents to a greater cause - their survival.  Selena's apprehension to stay with the group is complicated with her inner conflicts to maintain her independence, her ability to be able to survive on her own, her growing relationships with the people in a harmonious community and her building feelings for Dan.In looking at the plot of Surviving Passion, some of the details of later events bear questioning especially the hair-breadth escapes and last minute rescues which seems fortuitous but anything can happen in war.  One has to remember that Underwood was deliberately writing a romance and the plot is one of romantic action so I tacitly accept them as such rather than realism.  I appreciate Underwood's improvisation and creativity in developing a genuinely unpredictable story.One may arguably say that Selena sees herself as strong and independent woman surviving in a wilderness full of evil and malice.  However, I think she was lucky and very vulnerable.  Her means to survival was avoidance of people and trouble and in all likelihood, her luck would soon run out.  Because of her apprehensions and pensive nature, Selena is the only dynamic character from all of the personages.  She has undergone so much treachery and loss of belief and trust that the likelihood of total mental and spiritual reclamation seems slim. She has accepted her way of life because she doesn't know any other type of existence.  When she is introduced to a different way of life in Dan's community, she teeters on the brink of total acquiescence, a fact that haunts and terrifies her.  This makes her a complicated character and all the more interesting.Dan is depicted as the mythic hero, who fights all evil, protects the meek, and will right the wrongs.  He is the saint with a knife and his ability to kill with ease is a contrast to his reverence for life.  He could have been an interesting character but there is very little about him and his interaction with Selena was minimal.The other characters, while they generally act in keeping with their characters, are primarily static (including Dan). These characters are uncomplicated, some complacent, and one-dimensional. Because the majority of them do not change throughout the novel, we see only one part of their personalities -- their surface appearances and actions. The story is seen through Selena's eyes so this probably can't be helped but nevertheless, that's my only criticizm from an otherwise entertaining and good book.I look forward to reading the next book Surviving Seduction and more from Maia Underwood.",Very Entertaining and Good Book,1337472000,0,0,4,1

"This 2010 collection contains six horror stories, an introduction, and an afterward. The introduction explains the different types of literature and films that people consider ""horror,"" and stresses that horror tales must be based on suspense, as are the six in this volume. Shock, the introduction states, is ""not the defining characteristic of the genre."" The following are two examples of the stories.""Homecoming"" examines what the death of a beloved son can do to his mother and how his father reacted when the son's mutilated ghost appeared to him.""Haunted"" is about a man, his wife, and daughter who live in a haunted house.

Every incident kept turning into another twist and it didn't matter that this could never happen in real life. That's what a book is for, isn't it?

"I have to say Jessica Coulter Smith is doing something right when it comes to shifters and the like. If you have not already done so I suggest you read the prequel of the series called Whispering Lake. These first two books can be read as standalones though. I was hoping to see Cole's story, knowing that he kind of got left holding the bag in the prequel. So a quick recap, Cole is out and about in his wolf form when he stumbles upon Marin an injured battered woman. He calls for help from Cassie (Whispering Lake). Turns out Marin is a mate to one of the super hot brothers (in age order Gabriel, Cole, and Michael; the latter two are twins with different color eyes). Turns out Marin has been abused but is strangely comforted by Cole who adorably stays in wolf form to make her feel more comfortable.This book was given to me for an honest review.First, I want to say that I really appreciated the blending of the prequel with Moonlight Protector it was flawless. Second, the title is aptly named. Cole the lead male in this story is the protector in both human and wolf form. Cole purposely keeps to his wolf form for the comfort of the lead female character Marin who has been kidnapped and abused. Third, the humorous element to this story helps cut the serious nature of the topic. I really felt that the comic relief was pulled off nicely. My favorite scene is when the dirt bag who kidnapped her appears at the family's Victorian home asking for Marin; Cole and Marin come out of his room all over each other pretending that they have been up to no good, while Michael the constant jokester plays with the whole charade in order to protect Marin (the scene is a lot funnier than my lame attempt and summarization).I really enjoyed the twist that if you are a mate then your packs blood can heal you, I found this fascinating from an anthropology standpoint. I wondered if evolution specifically selected for something like that (just an errant thought). There was a great blend of drama, romance, paranormal, and mystery. Once again Mrs. Coulter Smith has transported me into Ashton Grove, Georgia and made me lose track of time. I was so absorbed in the story I missed Lunch! And I love lunch LOL.I recommend adding this book to your reading list and you will not be disappointed.Book Summary:Cole Andrews, biologist by trade and werewolf by blood, is tired of being alone. He and his two brothers live in the large Victorian home that had belonged to their parents. He's always wanted to find his mate and start a family. Now that he's in his thirties, he's starting to give up hope. He's already seen all of the women available in his small town of Ashton Grove and so far none of them are ""the one.""Marin Thomas is fleeing for her life. After being abducted and held hostage, she is determined to escape the maniac once and for all. Stealing his car, she travels as far and as fast as she can - until a car accident lands her in some woods near Ashton Grove, Georgia. Fighting for her very life, she finds herself begging a wolf for help.Is Marin the mate that Cole has been waiting for? Or will she end up with one of his brothers? One sniff tells him that she belongs to his pack. The only question that remains is who will win her heart?",Moonlight Protector is a great read!!!!,1388966400,0,0,5,1
"It should have been a day like any other but Anne hadn't even finished her morning non-fat latte before life as she knew it was changed forever.Right after exiting the coffee shot near her office Anne is approached by a man.  Only she quickly realizes that he isn't a man at all and wisely runs in the other direction.  The thing pursues her and Anne's fearful that she won't be able to outrun it.  Just when it seems hopeless, Anne is grabbed and she lets out a blood curdling scream.  Seconds later she's lulled to sleep by the man who holds her but first she sees a second man step out to deal with the monster who'd been pursuing her.Caleb and Van have been watching Anne for weeks.  According to the oracle the little bit of Valencia DNA she possesses makes her a perfect match for them.  Convincing her to leave her world and life to mate with them and relocate is a daunting task.  However, it's absolutely necessary because the Guardians have made it their personal goal to destroy all human females with Harmon blood and if the men don't take her with them now then she will die at the hands of one of the monsters.Being ripped from her home, career and life doesn't endear Caleb and Van to Anne.  Sure Valencia is beautiful and similar to Earth but it's not `home.'  There's no denying that Caleb and Van are gorgeous but no way can this all be a reality.  During the time she's in Valencia Caleb and Van become extremely important to Anne but can it really be love?  What about the Guardians threat to kill any woman able to mate with Harmon males?Anya Bast's TAKEN delivers on all those `out of this world' fantasies woman possess.  Anne's spunky attitude and refusal to blindly accept everything Caleb and Van tell her kept me chuckling - and kept her men guessing at what it would take to convince her to stay.  I was expecting a fun read when I selected this story but in no way did I anticipate the emotional impact it'd have.

"This is a pretty good young adult story.  The story-telling is a little trite, but the author makes up for it with very adult subject matter and a good knowledge of survival skills.  My main objection is the author's grammar and word usage.  This is not everyone's strong point, so having a skilled editor to check your book over is a must if you want to write.  This author has a hard time with possessives--both singular and plural, seems unsure of the difference between ""it's"" and ""its"" and repeatedly uses the phrase ""use to"" as in, ""They weren't use to powdered milk.""  It's supposed to be ""used to"".  These seem like small quibbles, but many people judge writing both by content and by skill with spelling and grammar.

Instead, these happen every time she comes around someone who is about to die. First her throat closes up, then she feels pressure in her chest, and if she doesn't get away then, a painful scream rips out of her throat, and she can do nothing to stop it.Whilst shopping for her prom it happens twice.

This is the story about Will and Mackenzie who have been friends for over 15 years and Will has been secretly in love with her all this time.  Mac thinks of Will as her best friend, someone she can count on and that won't leave her.  It is safer for her to keep him as a friend instead of becoming involved with him.  One day, she kissed him and for Will, that was the day there was no turning back.  He had to have her and had to convince her he was the man for her, that he loved her all this time and that he was tired of waiting around for her.  Mac has a special ability, where she sees the future.  She has seen images of Will and her and knew in her heart they would get involved and when they did, oh man, it would be hot!  After their explosive night together, will sees images of Will falling from a helicopter and freaks out.  She didn't want to continue the relationship because she feared if she did, she would lose him so she pushed him away.This one is not my favorite from the series, probably because I thought the main characters were not that interesting, but the story was nice and short.  It was nice to catch up with the other characters from the previous books, so that made it worth reading.  Of course, I am a sucker for romance and liked the steamy scenes and a happily ever after.

"GOD LAUGHS WHEN YOU DIE: Mean Little Stories from the Wrong Side of the Tracks - that's enough of a title tied with a terrific cover art borrowed from Hieronymus Bosch to make any inquisitive mind pick up this book.  The fact that it is the debut outing of classy actor Michael Boatman adds to the impetus, but it is the settling in with these nine weird short stories that  makes the reader realize that here is a new writing talent in the making.  The stories could be read aloud and be considered as performance art, so full of wild imaginings and colorful creations, at times repulsively detailed explorations of body cavities and characters who drop in like gargoyles to keep the eye and the senses alert.Where Boatman finds these ideas it at once curious and frightening.  Yet he is able to tell the stories with a superb vocabulary that seems to ooze from the page like a jellied corpse attempting to rise.  There is a lot of violence here, yet controlled with a sense of building tension for the reader to quickly turn the page for more detail.  His 'characters' are flat like comic book figures - until they speak or do perverse and nasty deeds, and then they are strong enough to resemble memories from bad dreams or dyspepsia.Sounds like a book that might be more than the average reader could swallow?  Maybe.  But it is definitely an art form looking for an incarnation and Boatman seems to be able to open and close each of the fairly brief stories like an able craftsman.  If the 'book' feels dissociative, then that may be part of the purpose of choice of format.  Whatever Michael Boatman has created here begs for development into a novel state, and perhaps being committed to a full-length book on one topic would hone the ideas and imagination with the skills he so obviously has at hand.

Not the ""fog"", but if any children were left to their own devises for a long period of time.Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old.

I would not have cared to meet the meek and conventional Margo in England but I would have loved getting to know the free-spirited, open-minded, and adventurous Margo that she became in France.Susanne O'Leary's style of writing was smooth, flowing and very comfortable to read. The descriptions of the clothes, food, furniture, etc. were exceedingly vivid and authentic. The atmosphere was so realistic that I felt totally immersed in the story and could practically see, hear, smell and touch what was happening. All the characters, both major and minor, had dynamic, complex and three-dimensional personalities. (I still don't see how Margo managed to keep silent when the Countess was bossing her around!)This was an extremely well-written book and I highly recommend that, if you like original love stories especially when they're set in foreign countries, that you read this book ASAP.

Many ""are the transients who came to town looking for a place to belong, a place that accepted misfits and rejects, no questions asked.

But, then, New Orleans is a city where twice as many people are murdered than are given government checks for hurricane damage.This is Maistros' second book.

Cathy did well by Rafe, and honestly she gave a whole lot more than she got from him.  Rafe wasn't a bad person he just wasn't on Cathy's level, but opposites do attract and that was definitely demonstrated here.

The intrigue was a little childish and didn't make much sense, but past that, the action was pretty thrilling, the author's imagination at its best in the creation of the crew of the Phoenix and the description of their habitats.

Because of that, he's the perfect character for a standalone short.You don't need prior knowledge to enjoy this one - Block provides enough back-story to keep a newcomer informed without alienating those familiar with the work.Here, Keller is a new person. He has a new identity, new home-town, a family and a socially acceptable job. Unfortunately, his work is suffering from the recession, so when his ex-boss Dot (no longer in White Plains or having the same name) gets in touch about a job, it's difficult for him to turn it down. The icing on the cake is that he can combine the killing with a stamp-collectors' conference.Keller's different in his approach on this one that I'm used to. A little rusty. Not prepared to do all the careful planning. He has Google (and maybe easy access to information has made us all a little complacent) to help him and something to lose.Thankfully he's still agile in terms of improvising at the scene.This job plays out unexpectedly. The twists and action keep the interest levels high.It's a pleasure of a read. In some ways this read is a little bit like a classic car. There might be the odd splutter from the engine and a dent or two in the body-work, but it purrs and flows when it's on the open road. It's all you'd want from a hit-man story.I had high expectations when I bought this and I certainly wasn't disappointed.Super.",Keller Novella is Stellar,1344124800,0,0,5,1

"I was hesitant to even download this book given my prior disinterest in anything about Iraq , yet it seemed to review well so I did. There it languished in my collection for months until I read another reviewer's comments of their similar appreciation for the ""Jet"" series by Russell Blake, and upon searching through their book reviews found they also spoke highly of this book as well so I decided I would give it a read after long last. Surprise, surprise! While it does bring some haunting events back to mind (like the Daniel Pearl beheading, water boarding, suicide bombing, etc.) I find I'm enjoying the book more and more. The character interactions are superb, the story is gripping the more of it I read, and I am acquiring a heightened appreciation for both the law-abiding Iraqi people and that of the coalition forces including our own troops. Overall, the book has become a very good thriller that has me paying more and more attention to the time as the clock winds down! I'll be looking forward to reading more of this author as a result and am that close to raising it to a five star read were it not for some of the subject matter.",Surprisingly good given my general lack of interest in that part of the world (Iraq),1370304000,0,0,4,1
"A novel full of magic and suspense. A strong woman, Miranda, sets out on what becomes a dangerous journey as she uses every resource she has in an attempt to locate her missing husband. She soon learns she cannot trust anyone, with the exception of a most unlikely companion: a stray cat that refuses to leave her side. And so begins an incredible mystery full of friends and foes and an increasingly difficult time determining the difference...The writing itself is solid (and well-edited). Characters are so richly described I felt as if they could walk right off the pages and into my living room for a cup of tea and a chat. The atmosphere crackles with vibrant energy; I could almost smell the salty sea air, feel the chill of a brisk evening night, and smell freshly baked bread wafting through the cobblestone streets. The author has a way with words that grabs a hold of the reader and refuses to let go. She creates a foreign yet familiar world and I was so entranced by her writing and this story that I found my mind wandering back to the curious and charming world of Miranda during the day and I could hardly wait to get home and back to the novel. I finished this novel 2 months ago and finally got around to reviewing it. In all honesty, I remember even the smallest of details after that much time and many more books read since. That is a gauge as to the intensity of this haunting novel and a testament to the author's skill.I would read this book again. And again. Whimsical, charming, suspenseful, mysterious, fun, beautiful, intriguing: I could go on with similar adjectives for hours. A very enjoyable and satisfying read with an unusual and satisfying ending. I highly recommend this novel, although I wouldn't start it before bed on a work-night. You may well find yourself reading into the very early morning hours.

They were all very well rounded and real to me.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  I am also pleased to say that this book had chapter demarcations.  It makes it so much easier to know how close you are to the end of a chapter or find a stopping place if you need to do so.

"The opening pages of this novel promise the reader an engaging story...but they ought to hold on because they have no idea just how much is in store for them.This was a very entertaining read for me. There is a little bit of everything in this novel from Egyptian mythology to tales of the old West; from the supernatural of ghosts and demons to Hungarian royalty and modern day law enforcement and military. It's impossible to sum up this book easily and that's one the biggest reasons why I enjoyed it so much. There was so much going on, the plot of the story skipping back and forth through time and place and highlighting many different characters. The authors deserve praise for the brilliant construction of their tale. They wound through the telling of this intricate story seamlessly and, although there was a lot to keep track of, I found it not only easy to remember who was who and what was what but I was enormously entertained and intrigued throughout.There are many different elements at play here in the first installment of this new series. Suspense, fear and humor are intermingled quite well within the plot and I thoroughly enjoyed the play between the characters. Each one of them was well defined and personable. There is mystery, murder, action and history all at once and in abundance in this novel. Because of this and the well-crafted cliff hanger that ends the first book, I am eagerly carving out some time in the very near future to read the second and third books as well.","Mythology, murder, mystery and much more...",1375142400,2,2,5,1

A Light For My Love takes place on the west coast during a time of sailing ships where shanghais are common. Harrington does a great job of making the reader understand the period and the events of the time. I think this is the first book I've ever read regarding this subject, it was an added bonus to learn about a part of history I didn't know before.Also like her other Kindle books though, the formatting leaves a bit to be desired.

"Secrets was a really interesting book and I'm definitely glad I read it. I was very intrigued by the premise and it sounded like a book I could really lose myself in and enjoy. I love books that help me relax and that are easy to read- Secrets was certainly one of those books!The opening of the book caught my attention and from there, I knew I would have no problem reading to the very last page. I needed to know what was going on and I wanted everything to work out for these mysterious characters! They were well written, believable and easy to empathise with. Tess, while admittedly silly and impulsive, was a fun character and I found it easy to like her. Joe definitely took some getting used to and I still don't think he's the nicest guy around but I grew to accept the way he was and his nice side completely shone by the end!Was Secrets amazing? Not really, but it was very good. It had one or two things that bugged for. I think it was dragged out too much and could have been condensed down by at least a hundred pages. I also really wasn't feeling the relationship between Tess and her daughter. It felt like Em wasn't really there most of the time and Tess didn't really seem to engage with her. Other than those two things, I thought it was an immensely enjoyable book and at no point was I bored or contemplating stopping.Secrets is certainly worthy of four stars and I am eager to read more of Freya North's work in the future as I do think she has talent.",Entertaining!,1324080000,2,2,4,1
"The retirement plan of the Kurev mob family is death; either naturally or by hitmen.  No one just leaves alive.  Cynthia Beller and Lee Maxwell understand that first hand as her father Claymore and Lee, accountants at the same firm working the blood money of the Kurev mob, tried to quit at different times.  Nine years ago Claymore and his family except for his daughter Cynthia were murdered; three years ago, Lee survived the hit, but his wife and daughter were killed.  Each of the survivors vowed separately vengeance.They meet for the first time as Cynthia having just finished a kill is about to leave when Lee enters the abode to assassinate the same thug.  They encounter one another twice more before agreeing they have the same list and strategic BHAG.  They agree to team up to destroy the Kurev family by dividing up the kills.  Meanwhile though sympathetic to their cause and respecting them as he loves his wife and daughter that he might seek vengeance too if they were harmed, FBI agent Owen Dunham struggles with capturing the Grudge Ninja vigilante serial killer preying on the mob.This is an exhilarating serial killer thriller that hooks the audience because the key three players seem vulnerably human with remorse, regret, and resoluteness.  The vivid story line is action-packed especially with the scenes of the kills.  However, A.J. Scudiere's tense thriller belongs to the Grudge Killer(s) and the cop reluctantly trying to bring them to the legal justice system even as he believes their vigilante justice is just.Harriet Klausner",This is an exhilarating serial killer thriller,1228521600,5,5,5,1

"Jason Dark comes from a long line of ghost hunters.  His knowledge and skill are unsurpassed.  So when mysterious deaths start occurring in London, complete with dried and shriveled bodies, Jason knows that evil is afoot.  With the help of a young Asian woman named Sui Lin, Jason tracks down the demon that is stalking the foggy streets, and attempts to send it back to hell.  Jason learns that the demon is on a mission; will he be able to thwart this evil plan?Guido Henkel draws his inspiration for his modern horror pulp fiction from monster movies of old, and does so quite successfully.  As I read this novella, I could draw from the same movies to allow myself to picture the story's action in my mind.  The scenes are well developed, with the action and mystery drawing you in right from the first page.I personally liked the fact that not too much was revealed about Jason Dark's backstory, as this is to be a series.  I hope we learn about him little by little along the way.  Even with that air of mystery, Dark is a formidable character right from the get go.  I am anxious to read more of the volumes to see where Henkel takes Dark next.I was impressed with the way this story captivated me.  As a seasoned reader of horror film and fiction, I can often anticipate plot lines in the horror genre, but this one was a fresh take on an old monster, a trend I hope to see continue in Henkel's work.  With the recent resurgence in certain aspects of horror fiction, I like an author who sets himself apart from the pack, and Henkel appears to be just such an author.I would highly recommend this to any fan of the horror genre.  Because of it's relatively short length and lack of gratuitous violence, I would even say this is appropriate for young adult fans of the horror genre.  In short, if you like short stories by Stephen King, I think you will love this novella by Guido Henkel.  I am excited to read more of this series.A copy of this e-book was provided for review courtesy of the author.","Volume I, so far so good!",1277424000,3,3,5,1

"I wish that this way of organizing material had been available years ago.  I never related well to writing outlines and always considered them rather fussy and unworkable.  If you think from the top down this is a great way to organize information because you never run out of room for the subtopics (one of my problems with outlines), and you can get the whole picture on one page.  I also appreciated the idea of using color, doodles, shapes, and thickness of lines to further organize and categorize the information--a boon for the visually oriented.That said, I found the book to be a bit shallow.  After the good opening explanation of the concept, the rest of the book seemed to explain the obvious. I gather from the other reviews that better material exists on the subject, but this one gives a good introduction.  I borrowed the book through Amazon prime, so I paid nothing and gained a great idea. I'm glad I read it, and may explore other books on the subject.",a good idea,1365033600,0,0,4,1

Embracing Silence brings two very different types of warriors together.  Silence has known nothing but the hard streets all her life and now works with the Resistance in hopes of bringing down the Council.  Created by the Council as the ultimate fighting machine, Tienan learned just what was important, and it wasn't the Council.  I was surprised at just how quickly Tienan and Silence came together, but when you are living in a lawless society, you learn to make quick and correct decisions.  The life that Tienan and Silence live is nowhere near perfect, but I believed they had discovered a perfect love together and knew to fight for it.  The ending was actually just the beginning for them.  Embracing Silence brought two lovers together forever while surrounded with the constant threat of death.I can't wait for the next book in the Alpha series. I'm a true believer that everyone should be allowed to live and let live and discover their forever love.JoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Embracing Silence,1268956800,2,2,5,1

"Amsterdam 2012 was a very good book.  I really enjoyed it and finished reading it in only two days.  I wish it had gone on longer, but the ending is a satisfying one.  It leaves the reader wondering what may or may not happen to the main character and the rest of the world.Ann Aulis is a college girl on holiday with her boyfriend Peter when they witness a murder.  A murder that kicks off the beginning of World War III.  It's an interesting look at political and religious fanaticism from both angles.  I've seen some negative statements made claiming this is an 'anti-Muslim' book.  They are very wrong.  There are religious extremists in every religion, and it's pretty clear in the book what the author is writing.  The main character is drawn to the Muslim culture while horrified by the extremists acts.Most stories about war are written from a mans perspective and it's very refreshing to see a young woman's point of view.  A girl who was niave and idealistic, thrust into a world where she doesn't know who she can trust or what is going to happen to her and her family.  I would liked to have seen a little bit more of Peter's actions while he was gone, but it's not a big complaint for me.  I really didn't care for him from the beginning, and I think a side story about his actions would have disrupted the flow of Ann's story.  She didn't know where he was or what he was doing, so it fits that we aren't given much either.I apologize if this review seems a bit disjointed.  There are already so many reviews, and I don't think I have much to add that hasn't already been said.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family.",Very Good,1278028800,2,2,4,1

"It is an interesting book in many ways. To be blunt, I find the ending to be an easy cop-out to avoid taking things to their natural conclusion. And that's the only reason why I don't rate it 5 stars to be honest.This book is a first-contact book, but it's much better thought out than most other of the genre. There are logical reasons why there hasn't been much if any contact before, and there are logical reasons why when contact is established, it's found that the universe is filled with life and other sentient species.I found the science parts to be just enough to make it believable, and I have real respect for the care the author has taken in making the world seem logical and plausible. In addition, he doesn't turn to magic or 'just how things are' in order to solve something which can't be solved in any other way. Except - of course - for the end, which I'll get back to.The politics of earth are logical as well. I see some have reacted badly to the US being perceived as the 'bad guys' - but to me, the US here are the good guys, they simply can't trust the bad guys on earth and the natural conclusion to that, is that things get worse not better. But, I don't see it as the fault of the US or the western nations - I see it as a natural conclusion of the tension between nations, and that some of the 'bad' states simply can't be trusted. Normally, this sort of politics don't work for me in science fiction, but here - it does. Because the author doesn't condemn unnecessary, instead he logically points out the differences where they are, and let the logical conclusions happen - even when they are bad.And I do enjoy the characters, and how they interact and what their abilities let happen.But ... the end feels forced. The author does resort to 'magic' or 'faith' or 'God' or whatever you want, to let it happen. And ... I feel that everything is wrapped up too neatly.(SPOLER ALERT)It simply feels to me like the author took parts of the ending of watchmen and tried to make it work but without the emotional impact or the vilification of an outside source. It feels too easy to me, and how everything is neatly fixed and everyone falls in line, through what in my eyes is basic manipulation. People simply don't change their minds that fast, and I have a real hard time believing that the majority of the aliens would change their opinions that fast when they don't have the incentive that humanity does).(SPOLER END).In the end, I give it 4 stars and I recommend checking it out. I don't think it's for everyone ... but I do think it's worth checking out.",Very good - with one exception,1330646400,2,2,4,1

"Daniel Atgard, the hero from the previous book ""Right Ascension,"" is back on earth, his space ship is parked in his back yard. Life is good.

More characters are brought in to tell the story as the reader goes from one conflict in exotic places in space to another.

"I loved the first half - hot, with more character depth and undercurrents that kept me from putting the book down.  The second half, while OK, seemed to lose momentum and character along with the change of viewpoint. I had the impression in the first half of two more equal men, both with larger than life impact. And a lot more...well, hot. In the second, both seemed to shrink. Literally, in the case of Gabriel. He came across as unexpectedly inept, skinny, young and foul-mouthed. Like an unattractive gangbanger. Granted he's had something terrible happen to him in this half. It was just - off - from the first half.

"Title:  Primal HungerSeries:  Pendragon GargoylesAuthor:  Sydney SomersRating:  AReview:  This book is definitely the start of a fascinating series for me - as soon as I finished this one, I went out and bought the rest of the titles!  Before I started it, I was a bit leery about how the author would pull off having characters that were both shifters and gargoyles.  However, what we wind up with is an intriguing and original paranormal series that captures your attention - and your imagination - immediately.Tristan has fought his attraction to Kennedy for months - not knowing she was his mate.  But when someone sets a wraith on her tail, one who  is forced to hunt her until he completes his duty - which is her death - can Tristan save her?  Even if it means leaving his brother to endure being trapped in his gargoyle form indefinitely?I loved these characters!  Tristan is the perfect alpha male, and Kennedy is such a fun character that she is a pure joy to read.  After all the months of being denied an outlet for all their chemistry, it is amazingly explosive when they both give in to it.  Best of all, the author manages to strike a great balance between sexual scenarios and the actual plotline.  This book is not one the relies solely on one or the other - but the perfect blend between the two.

"These stories were described as ""pulp"", and I would never have guessed that I'd enjoy them, but I did!  Immensely!  All 4 stories in this collection take place in the mid-1920's and have a definite 'feel' to them that is characteristic of the era.  Most of the mysteries set in this time period in Britain tend to focus more on the lives of the (usually upper-class) characters and only secondarily on the mystery.  These books put the mystery front and center, and while Drummond is definitely upper-class in terms of being comfortably off financially and without a need for 'gainful' employment, he's not nobility and he doesn't hobnob with the landed gentry.  In our day and age, he'd be considered middle-class, and this gives the stories a sense of familiarity.There's a great deal of action, and violence - but it's fistfight and rough-and-tumble violence, not blood and guts like so many modern tales.  It's the violence of a refined, genteel world that still remembers the eye-opening shock of WWI as a salutatory lesson in man's inhumanity to man.IMO, the first 3 stories were much stronger and more likeable than the 4th, which is told in a different 'tone' and 'voice, but the tales themselves are very well done and interesting.  There's a common thread running between all 4 stories in this book, so they lead one to another.  All were excellent examples of the writer's art from the time period, and still have considerable appeal today.  Highly recommended!  There is also a volume 2  with 3 or 4 more books collected to show the further adventures of Bulldog (who I must say is an extremely likeable character!).Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good.  I couldn't find any issues with the first 3 books in this collection.  The 4th wasn't anywhere near as good - there were many OCR errors, which did slow down reading somewhat, though not to the point where the book was difficult to read.",Mysteries that are about the mystery!,1309478400,3,3,4,1

They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other, their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book, it was beautiful, sweet, sad in places and oh ever touching, watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life.",Absolutely beautiful,1307232000,5,5,5,1

"Daughter of Deception is the first book in the Family Lies series.  In a lot of ways, it is a paranormal Romeo and Juliet.  Duke is the regional head of the Network, an organization of people with special abilities dedicated to hunting demons.  Viola is the daughter of a man possessed by a powerful demon and from a family with a long, dark, and mysterious past.  Against his better judgment, Duke takes her back into the Network and walks right into the demon hunt of his life.I was hooked from the moment I started reading the story.  Duke and Viola are charismatic, interesting characters and the dynamic created between them was fascinating.  The story was exciting, with a ton of twists and turns.  It had magic and intrigue, betrayal and loyalty from unexpected places.  There was pain and there was humor.  Aggie, Duke's grandmother, is one of my favorite characters in the book, being everything to Viola that her own family was not.  This was one of those books that you fell into and felt as if you were a part of the story.

"After an accident leaves him dependent upon his best friend to take care of him, State Trooper Dan Fletchers starts to see his friend Deputy Sheriff Rich Taylor in a different way.  When his dependence upon Rich thrusts them into intimate situations, Dan is amazed and afraid by what he's feeling for his best friend, and he especially afraid of what his feelings toward Rich implies.Rich doesn't share his sexuality with many people, not even his best friend of twelve years.  Rich has always known his feelings toward Dan went beyond friendship, but he never let himself believe they were feelings of love, until now.  Afraid of losing Dan, Rich tries to keep his feelings inside, but almost losing Dan in a car accident has Rich rethinking that decision.A Helping Hand is another terrific story from Shayla Kersten.  Dan and Rich's fears and concerns toward the new territory they were entering were so real and very understandable, especially Dan's.  Dan has a reputation for dating a lot of women and breaking a few hearts, but he was not a womanizer or trying to be a heartbreaker.  Dan was trying to find that special love and to his shock it wasn't with a woman but with Rich.  I hated how Dan treated Rich but I understood it, he wasn't trying to hurt his best friend, he was just afraid. Dan never considered himself to be gay.  To add to Dan and Rich's already fragile relationship, Ms. Kersten threw in the monkey wrench of a crazy ex-girlfriend and Jeremy, a character I loved and adored even more than Dan and Rich.  I enjoyed A Helping Hand immensely and I'm praying to the muse of Ms. Kersten that creativity will strike again and Jeremy will be in the center of it.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",A Helping Hand-A Joyfully Recommended Title!!,1262908800,2,2,5,1

I chuckled through the entire book and was amazed at how fun the plot was and how J. Morgan nailed the way this young woman faced life and took on her foes.

The plot and pacing were good, and the character development was great. The tension between the hero and heroine was one of the best aspects of the story. Due to the short word count, the storyline and backstory didn't have as much time to develop as I would've liked.

"I am a big fan of paranormal romance, and at this point have read hundreds of books in the genre. I struggle to find new authors and series that I haven't read yet. I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. The cover is cheesy and not representative of the book, so don't let that put you off. The style of the book reminded me of Kresley Cole, Angela Knight or Gena Showalter -- good romance, interesting characters and story that pulls you in. I loved the world building and the details around werewolf life, pack structure, etc.Hillary is attacked and raped by a crazy werewolf pack, turning her into a werewolf. She barely gets away and runs for her life. She sets up a shop in a small town well away from werewolves and works hard to move on. Four years later, she meets her first werewolf following the attack--this time a good guy--who is stunned to see her living in the town. She's a technically a rogue and should have asked permission of the regional pack to live there, but of course she doesn't know anything about werewolf laws, pack structures, etc. At first she is afraid of him, but eventually she determines he seems like a good guy. He encourages her to meet his wife and his Alpha Zach, the leader of the regional pack. When he meets with Zach to tell him about Hillary, Zach is stunned at the scent on his brother and thinks there's a good chance that she will be his mate. He is interested to learn how strong she is, and that she is likely an alpha herself. The story focuses on their relationship, her acceptance into the pack, and then working with the national council to deal with the evil pack who attacked her. A very entertaining read!In case you don't want to pay printed book pricing and don't have a Kindle, I ordered this from the publisher's web site as an ebook (PDF) for only 5.95.",3.5 stars: Surprisingly good paranormal romance,1262304000,20,20,4,1

You have to download it and open it, leaving it open for a while, while it formats itself, so you can use the search option. I know it works wonderfully, because I got it to work a couple times, but apparently I'm not remembering exactly how now.When you get to to work, you search by book, verse, keyword, whatever and it pops up wonderfully, making it easy to do back and forth Bible lessons. It's almost like flipping pages, but even quicker, because the search is fast.I like the American Standard version. It's may be different than what you're used to, so be prepared for that, and perhaps check it out with a sample before purchasing it, in case you don't like the translation.I know that as soon as I get the hang of how this formatted Bible works, it will be well worth the money paid for it.",Excellent but complicated,1360454400,0,0,4,1

"The Classmate Murders is a fun and clever mystery. The story is written mostly in narration style, which works perfectly with this main character. You can almost hear the character's voice as he tells the story and adds his own brand of humor.Jim Richards is a regular guy, who is mature, divorced, and living with his parents to help take care of his dad. When he finds his long-ago high school classmates are being murdered, he and his friends step in to try to find the killer and protect Penny, his new-found love. I have read many books with female civilians getting caught up in a murder mystery, but this time it is a man who noses his way into the action. The cops don't like it - until he comes up with some interesting clues. I enjoyed the variety and personality differences in the characters. It is also fun to read about people closer to my age.It is a reminder to younger people that love can bloom at any age, but I thought the romantic antics started to get in the way of the mystery. Eventually it got back on track and came through with a satisfying wrap up to the case.  I especially enjoyed the last part of the book that sets the stage for the following books.This is an enjoyable and distinctive kind of mystery.",The Classmate Murders,1280275200,2,2,4,1

I got very involved with these characters and am totally on the hunt for the next part of the story.  This story has romance,  adventure, a new way of looking at Knighthood; it has everything you could want in a fantasy adventure story.This is the first story I have read by this author, and I have to say she going on my must-buy list.  She drew me into the story and kept me up way past bedtime when I should have been reading several nights in a row.

"This is a great story about a young man who, despite his awful lifestyle, finds God's help and favor. There is a lot of first person narrative in this book. If that bothers you, you might not like it as much as I did. The story is told through the eyes of a fourteen year old boy. This is the first of a series and in my opinion you should read the books in order. I had a chance to Beta read the third book and parts of it were pretty confusing without reading this one first.

"This started off a little...haphazardly.  I wasn't sure of some of the phrasing and even had to read a line or two twice.  But the characters were very interesting, and the plot was quite intriguing.  The flow evened out perfectly and the first story was satisfying--I should have known, as is the case with a truly talented storyteller--this book would only get better.  Each story has its own flow--beginning, middle, end, and the book as a whole also has some great character growth. This isn't so much a collection of short stories as it is a set of adventures involving two (or more) great and funny characters.  There's wit, danger, intelligence--and most of all, Fun.

"Enough Good News is written by from best selling author of Religious and Liturgical Fiction ~ Audrey McKay; this book is a delightful story with a refreshing honesty about a group of friends who are living their daily life but some situations became overwhelming and they have to decide to depend upon their freewill or go to the Almighty to seek for solutions. Each Character in one way or another has experienced trauma in their personal lives and leery about believing in the unseen Supreme Being. The author adds references of Biblical scriptures throughout the plot.The colorful characters have some dark secrets that are hidden in the dark and until they are brought to the light, the guilt is too much. There is suspense, twists and sentimental events in this story. It is a fast pace story about lawyers and their cases they are assigned to work on. There is a blossoming romance, babies, children, family gatherings and Sunday services. In all an entertaining Christian tale about a loving family and friends all coming to their own destiny of being saved or not.

"Relentless is the 5th of a series of six books by Jack Campbell that collectively tell the story of Captain John Geary and his command of the space fleet which belongs to an Alliance of worlds occupied by humans.  The  books in series order are: 1) The Lost Fleet: Dauntless, 2) The Lost Fleet: Fearless, 3) The Lost Fleet: Courageous, 4) The Lost Fleet: Valiant, 5) The Lost Fleet: Restless, and 6) The Lost Fleet: Victorious.The Alliance has been in a state of war for 100 years with another group of human worlds called the Syndicated Worlds, or Syndics for short.  John Geary was thought to have been killed in the early opening attacks of that war.  In reality, he escaped certain doom in a survival pod launched from his Heavy Cruiser.  He was placed in a state of hibernation, with the expectation that he would be picked up in a few weeks, but something went wrong.  The emergency beacon on his pod failed, and he drifted until he was accidentally found 100 years later by another Alliance Battle Cruiser.He was revived and found himself thrust into command of the entire Alliance Fleet (which was lost deep behind enemy lines) and expected to miraculously get the Fleet home safely and to put and end to the war once and for all, and he was to do this against the overwhelming forces of the Syndicate Worlds.Compounding his problems is the fact that he must deal with a group of rebellious officers among his own crew, a love relationship that can not be acknowledged, politicians at home who want to arrest him when he gets there for a crime he has not committed and for which there is no evidence to suggest that he ever thought of committing it.  And if that were not enough, he also has to deal with an unknown enemy with unknown technological capabilities that is known to exist just beyond the border that marks the extreme edge of Syndic space.If you like SciFi that's filled with space battles based on reasonably thought out tactical plans and strategies, this series may be for you.  It is much closer to reality than the Lensman series, though I will not say that is a better or worse story line.  That is for the reader to decide.",Relentless,1283817600,0,0,4,1

"""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", like most all Jules Verne stories, are some of the all time greatest adventure classics. I saw the old movie of this book long before I ever thought about reading it. But, as it is with most books made into movies, the movie can't do the book justice. As this mixed group of characters, all with different backgrounds and motives, venture down into a cavern in search of the unknown, the plot thickens and the stories unfold. I will not ruin the story for you, however, ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a must read for those who love adventure and a book with edge of your seat mystery, excitement, and intrigue. This is a 5 star book, and if you listen to it in the audio version, or pick up the actual printed book, you will find yourself not wanting to put it down. Highly recommended for all ages from preteens to the elderly who have never, unfortunately, ventured into the world of Jules Verne.

"I have a version of ""Star by Star"" that does not include the novella ""Recovery,"" so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  ""Recovery"" tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in ""Balance Point.""  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship, it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out, like in the DVD's, where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it, but probably not to everyone.","Not a necessary read, but I liked it",1342742400,0,0,4,1

Then when I go to the other short stories that are suppose to be in chronological order, while they are about the same subject with the same people, they do not follow the same story. Each one started a completely new story, I wish it would go along with the story instead of jumping years at a time.

Wistril seems to be a pretty powerful wizard who has taken an very strict oath on non violence.  No matter the situation he cannot use magic to harm others.  This leads him to have some very creative solutions to problems that most wizards would solve with a simple fireball or lightning bolt.The interaction between Wistril and his assistant is always a source of amusement with Kern having no idea what Wistril is actually up to most of the time.  I will agree with another reviewer and say that I would have liked to get to know the characters a bit better to enjoy the stories more.This is the first book I have read by Mr. Tuttle and I can say that for sure I will be looking into more.",Wonderful short stories.,1295049600,1,1,4,1

"This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.Disclosure:  I was asked to do a review of this book by the author.A good story about wizards and dragons for all ages.A 14-year-old girl is trying hard to believe what her father has told her about Kimyra. When a creature she has never seen shows up, she lies so that she can have her own adventure. This is the second book of the trilogy.The heroine is a strong-willed girl, who has decided to have her own adventure. This story is exciting, fast-paced, and might have you holding your breath while some of the action takes place. It has all the elements of the first story, but the heroine has much more self-confidence. The description of the shadow world of Kimyra was excellent. I was not ready for the story to end when it did.Rick Just writes because stories are in his head, and need to come out. Good books aimed at teens and young adults can be hard to come by. This story shows the young reader that persistence can overcome the challenges in our lives, even when those challenges seem to be overpowering.I would recommend this story to teens and young adults. It is a very well written, fun to read book. If you have not readWizard Chase (The Wizards Trilogy Book 1)by this author, I would recommend reading it first, it will help you to understand the context better.

"wow...some of these stories are so bleak..the kind of bleak that has you shaking your head after you read the last word...This is a different type of book for Scott and as he says in the afterword, most of them are from early in his career....these are primarily dark sci fi stories which is something that goes outside the norm for your usual Scott Nicholson book...All the stories are solid but there are a couple standouts:Floating Cathedral Song--Probably my favorite and the best of the bunch.  This story is very powerful and when the truth is revealed it'll leave you hollow inside.Doomsday Diary--A close second if not a tie with Floating Cathedral Song for my favorite of the bunch.  Presented as a series of diary entries written by a teenager that lives in a world that has determined when the end of the planet is coming..for a fact...and it's in six weeks...bleak bleak stuff..Angelorum Orbis--Another very good story.  It seems that most of these stories take place in a common universe where the world is run by the 'Aeropagus' Corporation.  A mysterious and remote entity that controls the entire world.  This is a story of their thirst for expansion and conquest of new worlds.  But how can you conquer a world that welcomes you with open arms?The Taste of Clouds--one common theme of these Aeropagus stories is 'time is money'..literally.  You don't buy things with printed dollars or even credits.  You purchase goods and services by shortening your own life. This is a story of a man spending his time the way he wants to..literally...this one is practically uplifting compared to the other bleak stories that precede it!Honesty--An interesting time travel story.  Entertaining...not bleak for a change ;)Those are the highlights..the other stories are good as well but those were my favorites.The E book comes with a bonus story Sands of Memory.  Another Aeropagus story about a man who would think he's a god on a remote asteroid.This is a very good collection but be warned, as I've said there is some very very dark subject matter in these books.  Entertaining for sure but save it for another time if you're looking for a pick-me-up! =)","mostly dark and bleak, but good reading",1326240000,3,3,4,1

I rarely review (and then it is usually to warn someone OFF a book) However, this series is truly WONDERFUL. Creative and dealing with deeper issues than most.

"There are a bazillion cookbooks out there.  If I had to choose just ONE, this is it.I owned a restaurant for 15 years, and Cooks is the one source of consistent inspiration that I have found.What separates Cooks from all the rest is their discussion of what does NOT work in the recipe.  Things they tried and why they were not happy with the results.After a while you feel like you are a part of their test kitchen team and you know what to suggest and why.  Instead of ""cook booking"" your way through your kitchen life, you actually begin to internalize kitchen strategies.This book will not only help you with some fun recipes, it will make you a better cook.

"Delightful if you don't take it seriously as history.  Geoffrey said he was copying from an older book but I think he was possessed of a wonderful imagination and a really messed up sense of chronology.  Of course I love anything about King Arthur despite the fact that Geoffrey has Arthur conquering most of the known world instead of restricting his battles to Britain.  Arthur has gone to Avalon to be cured of his wounds and he has recovered he'll come back and get every thing straightened out, as once-and-future kings are s'posed to.  I am still puzzled as to why Shakespeare chose to write about Lear as described by Geoffrey when he could have written a play about Arthur.,",Delightful if you don't take it as serious history,1385596800,2,2,4,1
"I don't exactly know why but male pregnancy seems to be the bane of Gay Romance. I have even found a place where an editor pleaded her authors to not send submission of stories with male pregnancy since she was really tired of them... and I thought, how strange, in my experience I have not found so much of them. Well, this is probably due to the fact that I'm not a big fan of fantasy or sci-fiction, and so, obviously, I skim from the beginning the possibility to find them. But when it happened, actually they didn't bothered me, on the contrary, there are some series (like Space Opera by Stephanie Burke, when will she write the third book?) that I really like a lot. True, it's not easy to write them without falling in the mistake of having one of the male involved being merely a girl with male attributes, but well, that is the only way for a man to get pregnant!So, from the beginning Eresse, in Sacred Fate, is quite upfront with the issue, and she fully and willingly commits the mistake: Lassen, the man who will get pregnant, it's not a man with female attributes or viceversa, he is simple both, probably the most common way to define him is ""hermaphrodite"". In the fantasy world of Ylandre women are extinct more than 1000 years ago, and the males changed to be able to naturally bear a child; all man have both male than female genitalia, and when they give birth, they are also able to breastfeed the child. Only that, most of them, preserve the manly characteristic of being stronger and bigger than a woman, and so it's quite strange to read of warrior that can be also ""mothers"".Lassen is an Half Blood, meaning that he is of a lower class than Rohyr, who not only his True Blood, but he is even King of his territory. When Rohyr sees for the first time Lassen, he decides to claim the ""boy""; boy is a strange word to define Lassen, since he is 26 years old, but in this fantasy world, the coming of age is at 30 years old, and the acceptable age for breed even higher. So for that standard, Lassen is very young, but for the modern reader he is an adult. In this way the author cleverly avoids any claim of Rohyr being forceful on Lassen, but really, all the story has the feeling of those old savage romances where the innocent and very young heroine falls in the clutches of the wicked hero. And then don't forget that in medieval time, an acceptable age to marry among the nobility was, for women, 12 or 13 years old; I seem to remember that John Sans Terre's wife was 12 years old, and when they married, to John was asked to wait to bed his wife, but the ""wicked"" king didn't wait so much in the end.Anyway, Lassen's opposition to his fate is practically non-existent: when he is asked to become the concubine of the king, he quietly accepts his fate. For a good part of the book, like a perfect wicked savage romance hero, Rohyr masterly seduces Lassen to have him happy in his bed and not a sacrificial lamb. Maybe since Rohyr is a master of seduction, or maybe since Lassen for starter was not so against the idea (after all Rohyr is young and handsome and a king), Lassen is more than happy of his role, and he would be even willing to accept Rohyr official ""husband"" when the time comes. Lassen is in all for all the classic ""damsel in distress"", who gains strength from his knight in shining armour, Rohyr; if the reader wants him stronger, if he wants for him to be independent and all, well, maybe he is reading the wrong novel! Lassen here is the submissive lover, the bottom, and even if he can enjoy a variation in the bed role, in life he will never consider to be the leader, that role is of Rohyr, and to Lassen that is how things should be.Sacred Fate is a ""modern"" romance (man on man pair, male pregnancy...) with an old fashioned development (the damsel in distress, the knight in shining armour, even a bit of cinderfella...); for this reason I think can appeal to a lot of readers, but obviously not if you have something against you men having a bit of female inside.",Sacred Fate (Chronicles of Ylandre 1) by Eresse,1267315200,5,5,5,1

"I'm not going to bother discussing the content. Anyone looking at these reviews probably knows what The Economist is and believes the content to be great. The issue, here, is the Kindle offering, most notably, the price.Yes, it's expensive, and yes, I wish they'd reduce it a bit. But I'm not as outraged as some other reviewers.In comparing Kindle vs. web and paper, it is reasonable to consider, among all the factors discussed by others, the nature of Kindle itself. I notice that with the Kindle subscription, I find myself comfortably reading pretty much the whole issue. With print, I read just a small fraction.One factor, undoubtedly, is font adjustment. I'm getting to the age where reading hard-copy newspapers and magazines is becoming a bit of an exertion, so this is a huge factor. Of course web browsers allow for font adjustment, but I spend enough time working in front of a computer. I do cherish opportunities to do some things in different settings, such as an easy chair, or out on the lawn.I also wonder if the more stripped-down emphasis on text is a factor as well. There's not as much to look at with the Kindle edition (they do try to put in some pictures and charts, but visuals are not what Kindle does best). With the magazine, there's so much to look at, I spend too much time going back and forth. Ditto the web site, where there are so many things to click on. With Kindle, there are lots of little easily-digestible text nuggets and I just go from one to the next.I'm not sure if my explanations of why I read more on the Kindle version is accurate (I'll leave the details for amazon's usability experts to study), but I do notice the same phenomenon with my Kindle version of The New Yorker, where I abandoned the print version altogether.Speaking for myself, I'm getting a lot more bang for the buck with the Kindle subscription. Hence my willingness to tolerate the pricing.",A different view on pricing,1283731200,40,40,5,1
"A retired police chief is asked to help out In a murder investigation. I really enjoyed the set up of the main characters, retired police chief, living with a gay friend and working with the local police force on a consultancy basis. The reason I gave this four stars is because it would seem very unlikely that a civilian, albeit a retired police chief would be given such a free hand. Practically running the investigation on his own. Then when he finds peadophile  tapes he does not think this has much bearing on the case, but is looking for an unhappy house buyer??  The book is well written and I enjoyed it but came away a bit disappointed because of these points.Having said that I would definitely buy the next in the series and look for more books from this author",For Sale in Palm Springs,1404259200,0,0,4,1
"Angels' Pawn is the fantastic introduction to Singh's Guild Hunters series. Quite different in tone than Angels' Blood or Angels' Kiss, the novels that follow it, I actually enjoyed it more.The main characters in Angels' Pawn are the Guild Hunter Ashwini, and the vampire Janvier. (The main characters in the novels of the series are the hunter Elena, and archangel Raphael.) As some reviewers have mentioned, I felt a bit as if I was missing some world building backstory while reading the novella. However I had no problem figuring out what was going on, and it was one of my few complaints about the story.Singh's character development shines here, something particularly impressive given the short length of the book. Ashwini and Janvier are both interesting, well developed characters; they are each far from perfect, but their own resilience and self-acceptance gives them strength and makes them quite likeable. A cast of interesting side characters are also found throughout the story.Although the storyline touches on many of the same dark and violent themes that Angels' Blood and Kiss do, the overall tone is significantly lighter. This is due in large part, I think, to the main characters themselves. Their banter and sense of fun, as well as the kindness seen between them, gives a sense of perspective that the more solemn characters of Angels' Blood lack. Singh makes no attempt to wrap up Ashwini and Janvier's relationship in this story, although the particular ""mission"" is concluded. I think this was an intelligent choice, and far more satisfying than if she had tried to rush them into a happily ever after. Now I can't wait to see what adventure will bring them together next.",Excellent novella,1279065600,0,0,4,1
"The First is a magnificent collection of short stories that really showcases the breadth of imagination, talent and skill of the writer in the fascinating world of Dark FictionSplit into two halves - the collection offers an array of themes, from the grand Sci-Fi of the Aeropagan Cycle to doom laden accounts of the End of Days, a skip through Flash Fiction and a few stand out tales - representing the variety of published Fiction that the writer has accumulated over the years.The first half - Phantasmia - features a mix of fantasy horror and fantastical visions, including the stark horror of isolation in Penance, the drug-addled scrawlings of a teenager in Doomsday Diary and the desperate desire to be selected in The Shaping.The second half forms the Aeropagan Cycle - an Empire of conquest rampant in its inexorable growth that manages its resources by allotting all citizens a lifespan that is used to purchase experiences. An enjoyable life comes at a price of a shortened existence.From the arrogance of the ill-fated explorers in Angelorum Orbis, to the bravado of youth in The Taste of Clouds and the twisted, almost steampunk visions of Tellers - this is a view of an efficient but disturbing society that reflects a twisted belief of the value of existence.At times disturbing, always entertaining and clever - The First is a great starter for anyone wanting to get into Scott Nicholson's work. I first read his output in the collaboration Mostly Human, written with the other award-winning authors Steven Savile, Steve Lockley and William Meikle, and decided to see what else he had come up with. I was not disappointed.At this bargain price, and with an afterword by the Author and another Aeropagan story (his first ever published to boot) as a freebie - this book is definitely recommended.",Fantastically Dark Collection,1309478400,0,0,5,1

After being responsible for the death of her prior partner and love she has hardened her heart and does not plan on changing that any time soon.  However, since she does answer to the head of the Las Vegas Police Department she gets no choice in the matter.Her newly assigned partner Gavin McAllister is a good looking trainee with a faint British accent.

Then he meets said cop, who could maybe pass if no-one was actually looking because he is serious, he is mean, he is huge and he isn't going to be pushed around - Chris tries and fails.So we see, within the first scenes that Chris has to become the wife - wax and all, yeah wax everywhere.  And the pantyhose on a man means you can't even get a little bit, err, enthusiastic about things because the pain brings you to your knees.  Huh, how can you pass that off to the suburban housewives of crime central? Tell them it is your time of the month - so funny.Vin is tall, dark and yummy.  But he is silent mostly which is very discombobulating for Chris.  He tugs the tigers tail a few too many times and finds out that Vin can be very...expressive.This is a funny book that paints vivid pictures for us.  We laugh, we wince, we groan and we enjoy.

"I requested this book from Rebecca Forster, the author, because I loved her novel, Hostile Witness, and she was kind enough to oblige. I give this novel 3.5 stars.Before Her Eyes focuses on two protagonists, Dove, a hard-boiled small town policeman, and Tessa, the beautiful model that has vanished. The setup is interesting--there is a dead man in a convenience store, which is the last place Tessa was seen before she vanished. We see alternating perspectives between Dove in a tight third person, and Tessa in first person. As Dove tries to track down Tessa, he finds himself uncovering mysteries that others hoped to keep hidden.The strengths of this novel include some of the great description and some interesting plot twists. Forster excels at revealing secrets and bringing the unexpected.However, I had some difficulties with this novel. The pacing is a little off-- I found myself uncertain why we were following Tessa at all. The middle drags some as we wander around with Dove trying to figure out what is going on. And although I really enjoyed the twists, particularly at the end, some of them still don't quite make sense to me.That said, I still think Forster is one to watch-- and her Witness series is excellent. This was not my favorite of her books, but still a fun read.","Great description and good plot twists, but not my favorite of her books",1341619200,3,3,4,1
"I have just finished reading Robert Walker's ""Children of Salem"". It is late night and I am tired, but I would like to present my impressions while they are fresh. As with every book of Mr. Walker's that I have read, this one positively reeks of in-depth research brought to life in a compelling story. Mr. Walker has the ability to create three dimensional characters that breathe life into history. Throughout this book, the reader is drawn into a world where the separation between church and state is nearly non-existent and superstition and religion, as motivators, are a way of life.This book is an excellent historical novel tinged heavily with an everyday horror, not of monsters or things that go bump in the night, but of greed instigated, mindless cruelty of society against individuals.",Must read for historical novel and horror fans,1303344000,1,1,5,1
"Just finished reading this book over two nights and the tears are still on my face. Emotionally this was a hard hard book to read, but one I had to read. The story, as told from the cat itself was incredible, well written, and totally believable. I have owned several cats in my life, all of which I loved, and should have treated better, and this book reminded me of them.This book tell the story of one cat, the main character in the story. It is not a fairy tale, it tells it like it is. I think even it tells it better than the fate of many cats who are used even today for animal testing. It has some good spots, and some truly sad parts that will make you cry.The book has left me very emotional, as it will do to anyone with a heart, not just cat lovers. This book is a stand out book, which stands above those I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon. If I could give it 6 stars I would, because it truly deserves that. This is a book I think should be compulsory reading in schools, in the hope that it changes the way people treat animals for the better.Really worth beyond 5 stars, and a book that will probably stay with you for your entire life. You won't forget this one in a hurry.",One the best books I have ever read.,1336348800,1,1,5,1
"I have to start off by saying I am not a die hard fan of Richelle Mead's. I like her stuff well enough but I've yet to be blown away by anything I've read. Most of the time I would only rate what I've read from her around 3 or 3.5 stars. This is first book that I've read that I really liked. It was paced really well. There weren't a bunch of mundane every day activities. Everything that occurred tied in well to the overall story arc an I'm actually INTERESTED in reading the next book immediately. This story line was not as predictable as it had been in book 2. I feel like half way through book 2, I knew the ""mystery"" that was unraveling and it was annoying to continue reading the book because it felt like it too forever to reveal.  In this one, the mystery was much more well written and I liked the ending. Can't wait to read book 4.",What an improvement from book 2,1367712000,0,0,4,1

"This was a really interesting book. I read a lot of short erotica books but this one was more the proper erotica romance that deserves a review. Despite the short length of the book (85 pages), the characters were developed enough to get an idea of one part of their lives.Bev and Holden had a big misunderstanding a few years ago and Bev had been avoiding Holden since then. When a wise mutual friend decided that things needed a little nudge, not only Bev and Holden, but the rest of their circle of friends, they all received a pleasant gift from the birthday boy, Shane. They were instructed to share the gift with the person that Shane assigned them to. It was basically a matchmaking fiasco. Everyone was upset and walked out of the party.Bev and Holden were the last one to go. Before Bev could leave, Holden cornered her and demanded to know why she had been avoiding him all these years. Long story short, they ended up in the bedroom and admitted love for each other.This book was well-written with minimal to no errors and absolutely amazing chapters.

I started reading Andre Norton at a very young age and she is one of the authors who got me hooked on Sci-Fi. She wrote well over 100 books and this is a small collection of some of the best. I won't review the stories as there is an excellent write up in the product description but I can tell you that I enjoyed rereading every one. I kept every one of the original paperback books I purchased as a child to create a library and I have most of her original book releases.I wish that more of her stories were combined into collections so I could add them into my Kindle library. I would enjoy reading them again.These stories represent tales of man's exploration into outer space to find new planets and expand our reach to the stars. They are tales of encounters with peaceful and warlike aliens and how we met and overcame those challenges. If you like classic science fiction then you will love these stories.

"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",Great Collection of Fairy Tales,1291852800,3,3,5,1

"A great addition to the Kindle; I can't imagine anyone cancelling ""New York Times Latest News"" after giving it a try.

"Summary:Meet Kaylee Cavanaugh. She just wanted a day out at the mall, but when she starts screaming and can't stop she ends up in a psychiatric ward. The thing is, she sees shadows. When she sees those shadows, she has the overwhelming urge to scream. Kaylee is afraid that she's losing her mind.

This is just the beginning of uncovering a deep family secret.My Take:It's been so fun re-reading this book knowing what I know now! We meet Lydia in this book, then don't see her again until If I Die. I had forgotten she was in the early novella! When I originally read this novella, I read it after I had started the series.

She is a perfect heroine, working hard to get back the life she wants with Will. (Tying him to the bed, at his suggestion, was perfect)I didn't want this book to end.

"Angel's Pawn is standalone prequel, set in the Singh's new Angel's Blood Guild Hunter world of vampires, angels and hunters. The Guild  hunters are human bounty hunters hired by angel masters to retrieve errant vampire servants attempting to skip out on the hundred years of service that is the price angels charge for immortality.Singh has carved out a nice little vignette for this story and she does a really good job of fleshing out her starring pair:  Guild Hunter Ashwini, who is dangerous and a bit on the crazy side, and Ashwini's favorite target, Cajun vamp Janvier who is her ally and not her prey for this hunt. Both these characters were wonderful and the flirtation between the two makes me hope that Singh won't wait too long to give them a full length novel of their own since Angel's pawn is just a tease for the pair and their relationship is left ` to be continued'.  This lack of closure for Ashwini and Janvier gives Angel's Pawn more of an urban fantasy feel than Singh's Psy-Changlings though.I happened to read Angel's Blood first  and I don't want to spoil that for you, but the one comment that I will make is that Angel's Pawn has a different feel than Angel's Blood - Angel's Pawn only hints at the darkness of this new series and the beauty, danger and cruelty that is part of the ancient angels' natures.

"Willow Gregory has never had anything come easy to her, so why should she expect the night where she finally turns over the dreaded ""Miss Firecracker"" crown to be any different.  She had only entered the contest on a dare anyways, she really isn't the crown and tiara type, give her a carpenters tool belt any day.She defiantly didn't expect the morning to turn out with her waking up th a strangers bed with no memory after arriving at the bar the night before.  Now apparently she has not only spent the night with the hunkiest man she has seen in a long time, but has managed to trash a local bar.  Rather than go to jail she agrees to Blake West's price of working off the price of the repairs.  Especially when she thinks there might just be some fringe benefits.Will Blake's secret ruin all the two build while spending time together? Or will he realize what he might finally have in his sights, and come clean?I have to say I love the exploits of the West boys almost as much as I love their cousins the McKay's.  I continue to find Ms. James writing refreshing and just plain a joy to read and Miss Firecracker is no exception.  I loved how the premise of this story is the aftermath of Willow ""letting loose"" after a year of being a ""good girl"".  As usual expect a few twists and turns as the characters develop, which will lead to a fast paced and fun story.  I look forward to reading about the next West brother.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Miss Firecracker: Wild West Boys Book 2,1258156800,1,1,5,1
"I was thrilled to have stumbled across this book and I paid ZERO for it too, this was the first book I have read by KW and to say that I was left impressed and satisfied is an understatement! It was so incredibly well written for a short novel, it started quick and fast paced and ended with no questions left unanswered. For once an author does not go into such elaborate needless details and stuck to the story consistently without me losing focus, I could not put it down. This book has it all really which was a 1st for me as well, it had great fantasy, romance and sizzling hot erotica between Tucker and Mariah that never for once detered from their romance and did not make it feel cheap at all. I fell in love with Davina as well! I highly recommend this book and will look forward to adding KW to my fav author list!",Just one word: FANTASTIC!!,1331510400,1,1,5,1

I have thoroughly fallen in love with all the characters in both series and this book was a great introduction. Mike, the foreman, and his love, Kate are great characters who you can immediately warm to. Even though there are a few pretty wild scenes, Jayne Rylon does a great job of not making it feel sleazy.

"Satisfying romance. Reads more like a long short story or a novella than a true novel. The plot never rises above this couple and their attraction. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it does that well, regardless of where else the book could have gone.The two characters are likeable and attractive. The heat between then rises from the page. The few supporting characters and the dialogue between them all is just good enough to keep you smiling.This is a light read- candy-bar book, as I call it- but a good one. I felt it would have been nice if we had gotten to know our heroine as her own wolf, but the book never makes it that far. I imagine we'll get a chance to in later books in the series though. She was just as strong a character as any of the men.Nicely done- just don't go looking for any more than a bit of furry romance and some light comedy and you'll really enjoy this.",Cabin Fever,1282694400,2,2,4,1

"Annabelle Taylor works way too hard. She's close to reaching her career goals, but it has been at the expense of her personal life. What good is a corner office if you can't truly enjoy it? She has barely seen her family in a year, and she misses them dreadfully. Now she's home for the holidays, even though her smarmy boss gave her a bunch of crap about taking time off. She knew she was ready to take some time to wind down and relax, but what she didn't expect was the smoldering kiss beneath the mistletoe from long-time family friend, Rafe. She's known Rafe since they were kids, and has had a crush on him since she was twelve. Rafe had always thought of Belle as a little sister until five years ago at her law school graduation party, when he suddenly realized she had grown into a beautiful woman. Now he hopes there's room in Belle's life for him - forever.To Do List starts out hot right out of the box, and then keeps getting hotter. Lauren Dane has a knack for making readers feel the passion and excitement of a new relationship. I love how Belle and Rafe are up front with each other about the attraction they've been feeling for a while. The dialog between them is inspired, as are the steamy fantasies they share with each other.Belle is organized and goal-oriented. She's struggling with the idea of setting aside her professional goal, even though her current job is making her life miserable. She knows what she wants to do but it's hard for her to make what feels like an impulsive decision and a big change in her life. I think a lot of people can relate to that.Rafe is the sweetest guy ever, so patient and understanding you just want to eat him up. To Do List is a story full of warmth and holiday family traditions, and it's easy to see why Lauren Dane is such a well-loved author. You'll definitely want to read this one.5 Kisses, 1 Pepper~LindyReviewer, TwoLips Reviews, LLC[...]","5 Kisses, TwoLips Reviews",1214524800,7,7,5,1

"After reading the other two connecting books I really wanted to read this one.  It's not quite as good as the others but is still a great read.  I enjoyed getting to read Anthony's story as we met him in the last book.  His story is most interesting.Anthony is an accomplished thief.  After being caught in the last book by St John, he is the go to man for St John when he needs something recovered for the war office.  In this case plates for making money have been stolen and now he must get them back.  What he finds out though is the woman connected to the thief is a woman he has known from his childhood and has loved ever since even though she hardly noticed him.  While he tries to rescue her from hard circumstances he struggles with telling her who he is and that he loves her.  As the pair get to know each other more and his mission gets more dangerous she struggles with feelings for him and the fear for him being caught.A great read and a good addition to the series.

"Becoming Miss Becky was just as great at the first book in this series, Taming Eliza Jane.  Miss Becky arrives in a small western Texas town, but she doesn't quite understand what her dead Aunt willed to her!  When she finds out it's an ill-repute business that the town folk call the ""Chicken Coop"" she is more than surprised!  While trying to run this ""business"" she is also trying to find herself.  Not only does she figure out who she is as a woman, but she also discovers the Sheriff.  He's scary and willing to shoot anyone that looks at him the wrong way or calls his horse ugly, but he can't seem to get enough of Rebecca Hamilton.Another great book by Shannon Stacey that will make it hard to put the book down!",LOVE IT TOO!,1305244800,3,3,5,1

"The main character, Two, is a nineteen year-old prostitute, hooked on heroin. She is trapped in her life and has abanboned all hopes of life getting any better.Her pimp sends her to a new client and she mets Theroen, a powerful vampire who starts to change her.Due to the drugs in her system, Two does not become a vampire right away and remains a few months with Theroen before the final change. During that time, she discovers how intricate and dangerous the politics of vampire life are.This is not your typical vampire story. I  kept being pleasantly surprised by new concepts. The plot is well spaced and kept me interested until the end and, as other readers, i am willing to read the sequel.I gave it four stars instead of five because I kept wishing that the author explain, and better showcase, the love and connection between Theroen and Two. We get a very simple and quick explanation of why Theroen chose Two but it didn't feel real, logical or emotional to me.

"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  I picked it up because it was a free read, expecting it to be at most OK, but I really enjoyed the story.  The main character is a down and out heroin addicted prostitute who falls in love with the vampire that turns her.  For me, the ending was not even close to what I thought it would be.  In some ways a bit of a let down because it didn't really end with all the good guys living happily ever after BUUUT the fact that it didn't really follow the whole "" and the two vampire lovers lived happily ever after"" format was a really nice change.As another poster mentioned, yes it could use a good editor and there's probably a few story line items in the book that could use some work.  It's not a real thought provoking work of art, but overall it was a really nice, easy read.

"I loved this book and had a hard job putting it down. Quinton is world weary. He works for a company that assesses the environmental impact of logging operations, but life and tragedy long ago caused him to set aside his idealistic, green principles. Regina is married to the boss of the logging operation, a man who pretty much owns the town of Crow's Landing and doesn't care who he tramples in his pursuit of success and financial gain. Throw in Regina's troubled teen, Michael, and Quinton's part Native American heritage and the conflicts start to pile up, especially when Regina and Quinton meet and the spark between them cannot be denied. These two troubled souls can't ignore their attraction for each other, despite the risks. Their budding relationship renews their enthusiasm for life and gives them both hope that happiness is possible again. But the tensions in Crow's Landing reach snapping point and when the logging mill burns down, somebody has to pay. The plot is complex and fast paced, and kept me up late turning the pages to find out what happened. There are some great secondary characters, especially  Hurricane and Fury, the two dogs.

I look more forward to her mini ebooks as well as her novels and this book is no different.  The Greek Goddess of Strenght Nike (heroine) and the Lord Titan (Atlas) are two well developed characters that develop an intense hate-love relationship. This relationship quickly reverses itself to a love-hate relationship when the tables are turned and Atlas imprisons Nike to get his hard sought revenge after being imprison by her for centuries.  However once revenge has been achieved it does not taste as sweet as he would have like.  Atlas seeks for ways to make Nike prison life more miserable yet with each way he tries to torture her he is further torture by his growing feelings of love.

"It's nice to see an author go back and visit the New Jedi Order era. This time, Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more, or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion.

"Vic Bayne is a PsyCop. He's the psychic half of a detective team assigned to special cases where certain types of paranormal activity may be at work. His boyfriend, Jacob, is also a PsyCop, but he's the non-psychic half of a separate detective team in a different precinct. Vic rates as a level five medium (the scale goes to seven), and he's able to easily hear and see the spirits of the deceased who have not moved on yet. He also has a tendency to abuse his medications, but hey, if you kept seeing murders reenacted, you would too.""Secrets"" is a great read. We delve deeper into Vic like we never have before. His relationship with Jacob is being strained by both internal and external forces. He's being pressured to have a house-warming for his new place, but since he and Jacob aren't officially ""out"" on the force, he starts to more closely contemplate he and Jacob can or will be perceived by their peers. Also, he's come to discover that there's very little information about him on the Internet. None, actually. Someone, or some group, is going through great lengths to erase any mention of him anywhere.The characters are deep and complex. Victor's narration is addictive and compelling (and wittily sarcastic throughout). Romantic encounters are charged with eroticism and passion. This book is a little different from the rest in that it doesn't have as conclusive an ending. The ending is the obvious jumping-off point of the next book in the series, ""Camp Hell"". Being enjoyable in of itself, ""Secrets"" also serves to build great momentum for the conclusion found in ""Camp Hell"", making the two novels combined an incredibly enjoyable and passionate experience.

"Apocalypse meet vampires, I'm sure you two will get along great.  In this story humanity has really messed things up and is in a world of trouble that's all our own fault.  As if the end of the world wasn't enough though, now the vampires have decided that humanity is no longer organized enough to be any kind of a threat and come out in the open to conquer and enslave.  Humans are now cattle, drugged into submission, and constantly on tap to feed the vamps.  There is a glimmer of hope however, in the form of a small group of resistance fighters that have found ways to avoid the drugs and are now fighting back for real.I have to say this combination worked great for me.  It just makes sense that if vampires did exist and we all but wiped out technology and began isolating ourselves in ever smaller communities with little to no communication to the outside, then those vampires would see this as a great chance to take over with little to no risk.  And as happens here it would be simple for them.  The serum used afterward just makes sense, the vampires aren't stupid, they would come up with ways to control their food.  No aspect of the story seems unlikely at all, and the author does a great job of telling it.  If you like vampires, or end of the world scenario stories then I couldn't recommend this one highly enough, you will definitely enjoy it.",Best apocalypse or vampire novel I've read in a while.,1324857600,1,1,5,1

"What a truly delightful story; easy to read, rich characters, and just enough intrigue to keep you wanting to read more.  I wish Ms. Anderson had a couple of full length novels to read.  Her storytelling was good, writing was good, she built the characters as good as she could for a short story, and you really felt as if you knew them.  That was quite a feat to accomplish for this short read.Cherryville, single slightly ""older"" mom, dashing, handsome big city doctor...well, you just have to read the story.  I wasn't sure I'd like this short a read, but it was delightful, and I really wish it continued, or that it had been several hundred pages in length.The story is one that happens every day in cities across the U.S., but the way it was written really puts you in the middle of the storyline, and you end up rooting for the doctor (depending on which side you're on, of course), but I was rooting for him, while empathizing with her feelings on the age difference, though it wasn't that many years.Take the time to read this short story; I think you'll enjoy it, and it was a lovely break from some of the more intense reading we all tend to do when we're addicted to our Kindles.

"I've been trying a few of the Kindle newspapers and this was one of the first I grabbed as I am more interested in State politics and the Texas Longhorns. I found this to be a decent read knowing up front from all the reviews that none of the Kindle newspapers seem to be just like getting the actual paper in print. I guess with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I do get what I am looking for. There seems to be a decent amount of State politics and usually some articles on the Longhorns. I've got a couple more Texas newspapers to review yet but unless I get an unexpected surprise, this will be the one I end up subscribing to.

I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com.,Good but a little too fast,1229558400,9,9,4,1

"The Strength of Three by Annmarie McKenna is about Christina Marshall, TJ and Jon.  Christina is an employee at their security company and someone who has been on Jon and TJ's minds for months.Since she was a child Christina had to deal with her father who was an alcoholic and a mother who was an enabler, then as she grew up her brother started to show the same qualities as her father, so when she got the first chance she could Christina left her childhood home and moved thousands of miles away. But now that she's all grown up she has a horrible relationship with men, she can barely allow them around her let alone have a romantic relationship. But when TJ and Jon set their eyes on her she's in for a whole new experience.TJ and Jon have been best friends since they were in the SEAL's together, and from when they first started sharing women they haven't stopped.Now they have set their sight on Christina, and they dont just want a one time fling, they want the real deal. Now all they have to do is earn Christina's trust. Something that's easier said then done.Though the characters weren't as developed as i would like and some of the situations in the books should have been more fully detailed overall it was a cute sweet piece of erotica that wasn't too dirty or disgusting to read.

"The first thing I thought when I started reading The Long Weekend was 'creepy'! And I mean 'creepy' in a positive way. The idea is simple: two kids get kidnapped and end up in a mansion full of games and food. They don't really realize the danger they are in, not until the night arrives and the kids are separated.I really liked Sam; he felt real, believable, exactly like a smart eleven-year-old boy would be. He is resourceful and does not let panic and fear overcome him. Of course he's afraid, but he tries to use logic and reason to find a way out. He's resourceful and loyal: he manages to escape the house but gets back in order to save his friend, who, at first, didn't understand the trouble they were in.Lloyd, Sam's friend, is depicted as the 'cool' guy at school, the one everybody wants to hang out with, and that's why Sam is so eager to get his approval. During the story, though, it's Sam who realizes something is wrong, whereas Llyod is too confident and thinks Sam is overreacting. Then we see that something really bad happens to him and Lloyd is frozen by fear, incapable to think or react in any way. It's up to Sam to drag him out the house and only towards the end Lloyd does something which seems to shake him out of the state of shock he was in.I liked the story; it was a fast, gripping read and you won't put it down until you finished it because you want to know what is going to happen next. I found it very realistic and pretty scary. It also has a message: kids, pay more attention and don't take anything for granted!In my opinion, the only flaw is the lack of psychological analysis of the bad guy; I do understand that, as the book is narrated by Sam, it would have been impossible to know more about him, still I was curious to get to know him a little bit better.Reading this book was like watching a horror movie, one of those where you want to scream at the characters ""Don't do it! Don't go in the car!"" because you know something bad is going to happen. But, as it always happens in the movies, you cannot do anything but sit and watch (sorry, sit and read) while Sam and Lloyd face the danger.",Scary and realistic!,1337040000,0,0,4,1
"That's a product description that makes you want to read the book.  I found ""Before Her Eyes"" very ingeniously engaging, believable in plot as well as the rich character development throughout.  You find yourself guessing what the outcome will be but you will continue to read on because it becomes evident that things are not what they seem.  Rebecca gives an attention-grabbing ebb and flow to the writing style that keeps your attention throughout as you find yourself right next to Sheriff Connelly helping him along his path to find Tessa alive, her kidnappers, murder suspects as well as encounter corruption along the way that threatens to deter him from doing his job.

"Who is Captain Nemo?  Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist?  Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows?  Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology.  The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism.  All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent.  The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world.  A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent.  The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity.  There is no net gain to society by this action.  The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist.  Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself.  He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress.  He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine.  A world free from governments and country in which he governs.  A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive.  A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return.  Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile.  Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive.  His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human.",Who is Captain Nemo?,1308441600,3,3,5,1

As a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship I was able to see the conflicts in Ruth when she was looking for ways to escape without more people getting hurt.  I liked the ways the author showed the conflicts she had with killing or not killing Rewis, with helping or not helping Bobby and the disappointment experienced every time she thought she escaped just to be caught again by Rewis.  The flashbacks were a little heavy but they did put some context into what she had been through and what she was feeling.

"I must admit that I really like historical novels.That being said, this is a very unique book.It provides the historical story of Malintzin Tenepal, the hereditary Princess of Quetzalcoatl, who became known as La Malinche during the Conquest of Montezuma's Mexico by Spain's Cortez.  It fills in some gaps in historical knowledge, as all historical novels do, with speculation.  This makes the story flow. And at the end we are not sure but that Montezuma's Treasure may have been left as this story suggests.The book combines this adventure with a modern-day search for that very Treasure. And this takes place in tandem. We get a little of the current story and then we switch to the historical one and follow that. Intertwined.  This can be disconcerting.  Just as you get involved in Mexican border wars we switch to conquistadors on horseback.  But I thought this just made the whole better.And add to the mix the frequent transcriptions of a Mexican talk-radio reports to move the action along.Clever literary devices that will can spark your interest.The author has managed to tell the story of La Malinche and the Spanish Conquest and to describe the potential of a Mexican government melt-down while providing a colorful description of the heritage of the Americas.A terrific read.",A historical novel of Montezuma's Mexico with a current events thread,1282521600,1,1,5,1

They were there and I missed them completely!  I don't like a review which tells you the story; I don't think that's fair to the readers or the author so I wont do it.  Here's my synopsis.This story was developed extremely well.  Two parallel lives tracking alongside each other; each with their own demons, ultimately with their own peace.  The characters were rich and descriptive and the author did a wonderful job letting you into their lives while you traveled through their journey.Now that I know the outcome I will re-read this again because I'm sure there's additional depth that I missed the first time when I approach this book as a simple mystery novel.  It's not.  Read slowly and take your time to ""feel"" the words and understand the characters. The story is powerful, soulful and honest.

"Just for the pure enjoyment and entertainment factors, I loved SERIAL.  It is very graphic with violence, but I didn't think it was much worse than some of the thrillers that are out there today that I've read.  The two authors collaborating on this agreed that one mind was as sick as the other, and I'll agree, but I think the plot of two serial killers working alone and then what happens when the two of them meet up is very clever.  I read this very fast because I couldn't wait to see what happened.  This isn't SERIAL UNCUT, but a shorter version of it.  If these two writers intended to make me feel a little creepy, unnerved, like I had to keep reading, and totally entertained, then they accomplished their goal.  If you love thrillers and horror, something that gives you a very unsettled feeling, then this is for you. This is the first time I've seen the term ""recreational murder"" in any kind of mystery or suspense thriller.  I hope that's one term that doesn't become popular.There are three other excerpts from books included:  Desert Places by Blake Crouch, Shaken by J.A. Konrath, Draculas by J.A. Konrath, Jeff Strand and F. Paul Wilson.There is a list of each authors' works that are available for the Kindle at the end of the last excerpt. I didn't recognize the name of J.A. Kornrath, but he's the author of the Jack Daniels thriller series which includes Whiskey Sour and Bloody Mary.  I've read Whiskey Sour and enjoyed that one.  The authors are not unknown authors, and if you like things that go bump in the night or even in the daytime, then SERIAL is a good choice for a free download.","""Recreational murder...""",1309046400,0,0,5,1

He sustains some burns and his wife dies. He rarely comes out in public because he feels women will think him a monster because of his looks, and some do. He meets the heroine who is considered plain looking and also a wallflower. They are interested in each other. They get married. This book is about two people who at first don't think they will find the kind of relationship that they want. They slowly learn to trust. The love scene are slow at first and gradually build.

"I was hooked right from the beginning. I love the way these two men met. It was so funny and instantly made me love them both. They had seemingly clashing personalities despite a deep mutual attraction.I loved the character Edward. He was emotional, very loving, and had a lot of personality - flamboyant, yet not effeminate. Okay, he was a bit of a brat, but he made up for it in other areas. I love that he and Winston (the bulldog) wore matching bandanas. So funny. And the fringe. Oh man, the fringe.And Jack was very likable, too. He was temperamental and demanding, but at the same time, very goodhearted. His anger was understandable once we learn more about his lifestyle.I read another review that said these two had no chemistry. Are you kidding me? These guys were so H.O.T. together! Edward secretly wanting to be manhandled by a big, tough, cowboy - and Jack, wanting to just grab Edward and make him his. UNF. When they finally get together it was the perfect combination of hot and sweet. These boys are going to make each other so happy.

"Jake is a rich and successful business man. Emily is his Executive Assistant.  Jake sees Emily is a very hard working, efficient and a loyal employee, average looking (which is good, no office romances allowed).  He doesn't seem to notice but everyone around him notices how Emily is very attractive in her own way.  Emily is trying to meet people to date and suddenly Jake feels the need to be protective and ""responsible"" for her.  He offers to introduce her to people he knows and to teach her everything she needs to find someone appropriate to date.  The more time he spends with her, the more he realizes how much he wants to keep her just for him.The banter was so fun in this book.  Some situations were so funny. It was a well written book.

"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga,"" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.  Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to ""own"" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than ""property.""The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English ""Age of Innocence."" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (""Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl"") and lushly written descriptives (""... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago"").As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to ""own"" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the ""Forsye Saga,"" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.",A man of no property,1269475200,17,17,5,1

"My Review:Mya has worked with Milo at an advertising agency, competed with him for accounts,  and been his friend for five years. They started out in Atlanta, but when she realized she was falling in love with him, she decided it was time for a change and headed to the Mirage Agency in DC. Shortly thereafter, Milo was offered a job at the same agency and he accepted the offer and now they are working together again, which is slowly driving Mya insane as she is lusting after him. What she doesn't realize, is that Milo is having the same issues.The tension culminates to a head when the two place a highly sexual bet over an account which results in a weekend full of incredible passion. Milo is trying to figure out how to expand the weekend into much more, but Mya doesn't realize where his head is, and is worried about losing her heart and her friend.This is a hot little book with tons of really passionate loving. These two are best friends, but neither one realizes what the other is thinking which created the tension for the book. I like that they have a highly competitive relationship at work. I thought that it added an interesting element to the story. There was an interesting twist at the end that I really enjoyed with their careers, which I didn't see coming. I also really liked what Andre added to the story and LOVE that his story is next.If you are looking for a hot little read, this is a good one.",4-star review...,1315958400,0,0,4,1

"Kate Harper needs a place to stay while going through a divorce from her philandering husband. She has suffered in more ways than one in her loveless marriage and she just needs time and space to regroup and carrying on. She prefers life in the country to the city and needs to rebuild her self-esteem as she continues her secret writing career.Rick McAllister, a bachelor DEA agent, agrees to let Kate housesit for him and his partner as no one else seems to want the job. He did have one stipulation though and that was that she had to take care of their big, scary dog too. Kate is afraid of dogs, but her needs far outweigh her fear and she takes on the job.Kiss me, Kate was my first foray into Mari Carr's work and if this is an example of what this author can produce it won't be my last. I liked that the characters took the time to build a relationship using the technology of today instead of jumping on each other at the first opportunity. The development and change of her character was believable as she lets her inner self out instead of being a doormat trying to live up to other people's expectations. It was also nice to see that the self-assured Rick McAllister has some fears about Kate liking him for whom he truly is and being able to handle the games he likes to play because he would certainly like to experience them with her. Some of the scenes seemed so lifelike and I really enjoyed the phone conversation between Rick and Kate after her divorce, it seemed like it was a real phone call taking place. Kate had an endearing quality of letting things fly out of her mouth even when she was muttering them and Rick was truly that white knight that charges into the rescue just when you think it may be too late. I liked that Kiss me, Kate had Kate becoming more self-confident before exploring her wanton side with Rick and ceding control to him. I also enjoyed that they took things slow in the bedroom before jumping in feet first. Kiss me, Kate was truly an enjoyable read and I'm glad I took the time to read this author.Vanessa for Joyfully Reviewed","""Kiss me, Kate was truly an enjoyable read and I'm glad I took the time to read this author.""",1360886400,0,0,5,1

"Well, I must stay that over the past several years a worrisome trend has reversed itself and we have recently been treated to a growing number of YA books that not only present a good story, but ones that are well written.  The reason for this, in my opinion, is due to the increase in quality books such as the one being reviewed here by PV Lundqvist. Readers and teachers are demanding more and they now are receiving it.  What a delightful read this one was.Young Benny (Actually, his name is Bengt, something the young lad changed to Benny on his own, as soon as he was able), wants a pet.  He will settle for a cat but what he really wants is a dog.  Benny has been blessed with, or cursed with...depending on how you want to look at it, a ""creative"" mother, ergo the name Bengt; a name that is not ordinary and common, you see.  Well anyway, on his birthday Benny indeed does receive a new pet, not a cat, not a dog, not even a cool big lizard; no, no, no...a Vietnamese Potbellied pig no less!And so we are instantly drawn into the life of Benny, a kid who wants what normal kids his age want; acceptance, making the baseball team, no hassles from bullies and of course a dog.  Like real life though, not all always turns out the way our young lad would like.  There seems to be trouble from every direction.  There is of course the acceptance factor, relationships with family members and life's lessons to be learned.This is a well told tale of growing up; of being at that very strange and difficult age when a boy is leaving childhood behind and is learning to join the adult world.  The author has skillfully woven family, school, community, friends, baseball, rivals, and of course pets into a story which is quite often full of humor, often filled with the anxieties of growing up, and above all, the lessons learned during this difficult period in the maturation process of us all. But make no mistake; not all is grim life.  This writer has a keen sense of humor and it shines through on almost ever page.Lundqvist has gotten his characters down perfectly as well as the relationship between these various characters as the story progresses...including that of the pig.  The story moves on at a very nice clip which causes the work to be a bit of a page turner in a mellow and concerned sort way.  I liked that.  I also noted that there was not one instance or incident in the book that was not completely believable.  This would also hold true for each and ever character which allows almost instant empathy on the reader's part on all fronts.  The reader will be able to absolutely identify with not only the characters but also the dilemmas and situations as they pop up in young Benny's life.Being ""officially"" retired now, I spend my days as a substitute teacher, and for the most part work with kids of middle school age; the age this young boy in this book.  It should also be noted that my wife and I were one of the first breeders of Vietnamese Potbellied Pigs in the United States and spent several years raising, training and showing these little creatures.  We have had several ""house pigs"" of our own.  I can fully attest to the fact that this author does now his middle school age children and does know his pigs!I have been preaching all my life that each of us must follow their own drummer, and if perchance some of us choose a tambourine player, well so be it; so much the better!  The author has worked in several very important lessons in this work without being preachy or overbearing in the least.  As a matter of fact, he is rather sneaky about it.Strong plot, good and believable characters, crisp prose and a story line that moves; what more could you want in a book?Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",A TRULY WELL WRITTEN YA NOVEL.

I don't choose a book for whether it has graphic scenes or not and for some reason, when I read that tagline, I always feel like the story is defective or a quick short story and not one of their better works.  This actually was one of Ellora's better stories.Possible spoilers from this point forward.Damien is a nice mage. He lives a good life as a Viscount and he's happily living in obscurity until he comes across a young lady of 15 years, walking to her death into the tide.  He rescues her, sends her off to a school for young ladies and then when she's 18 and beyond the legal reaches of her guardian, brings her home to live with him and his sister.  The only part of the story I didn't get was that there were a lot of rumors about the evil Baron, who raped Toria and how her father failed to notice these rumors or protect her from them and even made the Baron her legal guardian.  Even while trying to guard her reputation, it seems like the Viscount could have had enough information to have the Baron arrested for other reasons and safely jailed or executed or whatever.  But he manages to be a threat throughout the entire story and I think even if he had never been introduced into the story, he was definitely a villain in Toria's mind.There were some side characters that were interesting as well and it would be nice to see their stories as well.  Not deep literature, but definitely served it's purpose of entertainment and an escape from reality.",An enjoyable quick read,1344384000,5,5,4,1

While he wishes his life had afforded better opportunities, it is convenient living there so he can help his Mother with his ailing Father.One night Jim receives an e-mail from an old high school friend asking for him to call, that she needs his help. When he picks up the phone and calls, he is greeted on the other end by a police officer informing him his friend had been murdered. Jim is stunned by this revelation and wonders what is going on?He contacts his long time cohort, Buck who convinces him he needs to look into things. As things progress and Jim and Buck are still befuddled, another classmate is murdered! What is going on?? Who is targeting Jim's classmates and why? Jim finally figures out the pattern of the killings and he and Buck go out of their way to protect the people they think are listed for murder.It turns out this is no ordinary murderer, but a very brave and cunning one, who will even make their kills with the police present. How can Jim and Buck protect anyone from such a brutal killer??I really enjoyed reading The Classmate Murders. I love the senior citizen hero, Jim Richards and also like to see our love lives will not end after 40. I even snuck this book to work with me to read at lunchtime. One of my favorite things about the book, is that the character's seemed so real to me, as if you could run into any of them on the streets and enjoy meeting them. A great combination of murder, thrills, romance and excitement. I highly recommend reading The Classmate Murders by Bob Moats. I just ordered ""The Vegas Showgirl Murders"" by Bob Moats.  I hope I enjoy it as well!",A Great Read!,1333324800,1,1,5,1

"If you are like me you enjoy reading historical romances and learning a bit of the lifestyle those individuals experienced, especially women.

Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first.

"A death in the family is often a traumatic event, with all of the surviving family members flocking to support each other -- and to assure themselves that nobody gets a better hand-me-down than the others.  This Southern novelette tells about one such country family, concerned with the fate of the tractor, the old plowhorse, the Japanese rifle, and more, with less concern given to the grieving widow.As a courtesy to the grieving family, food is dropped by, until there is such a quantity that no one could consume it before it spoiled in the summer heat.  Every good cook in the area is known for a particular dish, and by the same token, there are some dishes one learns to avoid.  There is a very special pie melting into goo on the table, and it has to be eaten...or does it?Ultimately it's a story about an extended family dealing with a life-changing event.  Is the presence of a graveyard on the family farm going to be a problem in the future?  Will the widow be able to manage on her own?And then there's that unusual pie...",Family is as family does,1267920000,4,4,4,1

I can definitely understand how some did not like the book if they were looking for a realistic detective novel, but this author creates a perfect blend of fantasy and reality that is really appealing.  The storyline is engaging from page one and Sara and Dagger have a great and captivating chemistry.

"Initially I was not interested in buying a protective cover for my new Kindle, but I soon discovered that one is absolutely necessary. I take my kindle with me to the gym, and after a few trips I started discovering little scratches on the reading surface. These could eventually really damage the device and start to seriously interfere with the reading experience. I decided to get Belkin's Sleeve case, since I did not really need an upper-end case for my needs, just something that protects my Kindle. Now that I own it, I am really happy with the case: it is well made and durable, and kindle fits very snugly within. The double zipper makes it also very easy to take the Kindle out.

"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband, a twin, has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still, they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover, jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple.

It was his beastly attitude, but I loved him anyway.  I was able to see behind the facade and so was Lila.  This was a modern days spin of Beauty and the Beast and Indecent Proposal.  I loved it.

Since Simon's death, Wade has not been able to move on, so Dylan comes home to try and make Wade realize that life is still worth living.

GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain.

"I haven't read this whole series. I only read Zsadist's story, Lover Awakened, and became enthralled by him. I fell in love with his character. In fact, the entire reason I'm not going back to read the rest of the series is the way the author tells the story--there were so many other points of view in Zsadist's book that I felt it took away from the true romance being told. It appears to be her style and the book's not a romance, so there's nothing wrong with it. It just isn't for me. So, when I found out about this book, I had to have it. I adored this book. I loved getting the deeper look into him and I loved having that final closure for him, watching him truly heal from his wounds. Very sweet book. If you read any of this series, read Zsadist. This is a hero who will be with me for a long time. She told his story with an almost eerie realism that only made me fall in love with him. The wounded hero. Love love love it.

"I was afraid that this would turn out to be a Lord of the Flies type of book. I was very happy to find out that it is not.The story is about a campground of mostly pre-teens, who end up being without any adult supervision after a fog, of unknown but deadly variety, cuts them off from most of the world.The only adult that was left at the campground was a 20 year old counselor, who seems to withdraw into herself and out of the issues that are coming up.A small group of kids end up taking charge of the group. And they do very well at it. The leader, nicknamed Chief, is Mike, a 13 year old teen. Nobody else seems to even have any ideas of what to do, other than himself and a few of their friends.This book takes place over a time period of about 3 years. Mike is 13 when it starts and is one week shy of 16 when it ends.I didn't have much of a problem with some of the age differences. One of the couples was a 17 year old teen and a early to mid 20's woman. I didn't find that at all unusual, or upsetting. I thought that the remarkable strength, of 20 year old man who is sexually targeted by a 14 year girl, was kind of neat.It does need some editing. I did not, and do not, understand why they are at a camp that aims to teach them abstinence. That, IMO, was just weird. I wish that there had been more to the backgrounds of these kids. We find out about a couple of them, but even that is lacking.",Not bad,1318377600,0,0,4,1

"For the love of Anna has made me love the way Lawless tells a story, and led me to read two more of his books (Finding Penelope and The Avenue), and I won't be stopping here. When I read Lawless I feel like the time when I was in college and a single Grisham novel was never enough, and you had to get your hands on another just as you were finished with one. Of course, I'm not comparing the authors, but only stating that Lawless is one master of a storyteller!In For the Love of Anna, Lawless incorporates into a simple boy meets girls plot, a deeper aspect of our world's gentry that is mixed in white collar offense. A look into what power does to people, and what people can do to get that power. How a single turn of events can create a chain reaction of enormous proportions and lead even the simplest of people to do the unthinkable.What happens when the very people who are chosen by us to uphold the law, break it and cause insufferable pain? And what happens when those very people try to bend the law that they make themselves only so they can get away with the punishment that comes with committing the crime. And would you really blame the people whose lives are singularly affected by the crime, when they take the law into their own hands after such injustice is done.

"Crystal Moran's engagement to Greek tycoon Demetrius Vartolas ended three years ago amongst his accusations of infidelity.  She's spent the intervening years getting over the heartache.  She thought she'd been successful at exorcizing him from her heart but his appearance at the Margarita Andresen Foundation fundraiser proves that she's still in love with him.  She's as much in love with him now as she ever was, but there's no way she's going to put herself through the pain of trusting him with her heart again.  Not even for the sizeable donation he's offering for her undivided attention while he's in New York.Demetrius Vartolas is a proud man who's well aware he made a huge error when he accused Crystal of cheating on him three years ago.  His jealousy got the better of him and he spoke without thoroughly examining the evidence and lost the woman he loves.  While he'd like nothing better than for Crystal to welcome him back with open arms, reality is that he hurt her and if he hopes to have any chance of rekindling their relationship he'll have to use any opportunity open to him - and her dedication to the Foundation proves to be the most convenient way to ensure she spends time with him.Crystal's stunned when she notices Demetrius's appearance at the Foundation's fundraiser.  Because of his status as one of the world's wealthiest and most eligible bachelors his presence at any event guarantees it to be a success but that doesn't make the situation any more tolerable for Crystal.  With a bit of champagne for courage she hopes to make it through the evening unscathed.  Unfortunately that isn't to be because she's soon confronted by Demetrius's partner and best friend Makis Stratus who always seems to be just paces away from Demetrius's side.  She's never trusted the man and his superior attitude has only cemented her dislike of him.Demetrius's timely interruption of her verbal sparring with Makis could be construed as a blessing or disastrous since she's now forced to acknowledge his presence and the feelings she still has for him.  When Demetrius offers to donate whatever is needed to secure the foundation's finances for the next five years in exchange for her undivided attention for a few days Crystal's sorely tempted to take him up on the offer.  If he already believes her to be untrustworthy and unfaithful why would he want to spend any time at all with her?  For Crystal, it's a simple matter of reveling in the passion they once shared, but as her feelings are brought to the surface so are questions about the `proof' of her infidelity.  How will she react when she uncovers the truth behind the `evidence?'Brandi Michaels certainly doesn't mince words in her short story JEALOUS LOVER.  Crystal and Demetrius's engagement was ripped apart by jealousy and insecurities but it's obvious that there's still a lot of love between them.  This story is sexually charged and intense right from the beginning but there are plenty of emotional connections that allow readers to enjoy every aspect of this couple's relationship - whether fighting or loving.  Ms. Michaels delves into the heartache over a broken engagement and betrayal and brings readers a story that will leave them smiling.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",4.5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies,1249862400,9,9,5,1

"I loved this book because it veers away from the traditional romance book where the main characters are hot, yet caring. The hero in this story has burn scars on a third of his body, and even before he was scarred, he wasn't the most handsome guy in the ton. The heroine is your basic girl geek and is described as plain or as a dog by the ton.I found it endearing that the hero had such low self esteem and that it was up to the heroine to bolster his self image. So many times in romance novels it is the other way around.I love the author's writing style. It is easy to follow and down to earth. There were some spelling issues here and there, but nothing that made me want to close the book.

She uses this information to get close to Celino.Celino, a financial genius, is drawn to the mysterious woman who fits so seamlessly into his life. He doesn't know that they've met before, that he has a lot to make up for, and that she could kill him at any minute.In most He Done Them Wrong books, the male lead seems to get off too easy - he drops a smoldering look, maybe some ""I'm sorry's"", add in some sexual chemistry and all is forgiven.

He really knew nothing about her and for him to get this intimate with her in this type of situation didn't seem like an honorable decision. She really could have turned out to be much younger than she had told him she was. It also didn't work because immediately after being assaulted by one man she just met, she got intimate with another man she just met. Some of their scenes take place in car but it was a little confusing exactly how they were positioned. Also, just a small pet peeve of mine of littering, one of the characters just simply opens the window and dumps ""something"" right onto the street and he was a cop.Once you get past their initial meeting, the story is good with a good amount of suspense and romance!",Enjoyable,1362182400,0,0,5,1

"After the sudden death of their mother, Keira Collins finds herself juggling six younger siblings and sharing the workload in the family's pub, while sacrificing her dreams. Many years later Keira finally decides to pursue the college degree she's always wanted. The only distraction is hot Professor Will Wallace, who stars in her wild fantasies. Fantasies that suddenly include her bent over his desk.Professor Wallace is instantly attracted to Keira the moment she steps into his class. He has worked hard to keep his personal life separate from his professional one, so no one would guess that he is a Dominant and that his desires for Keira run dark and deep. He recognizes the submissive in her, but will her need for control become a barrier in forming a relationship with him?Come Monday by Mari Carr was a great read. The introduction completely captured my attention and the sexual chemistry between the two main characters is sizzling! Ms. Carr introduced all the siblings and each one has a distinct personality. The family dynamics brought out the softer side of Keira even as she is known to be the most attractive of the bunch and continually feels that she has to prove herself somehow. Both Keira and Will struggle with letting go of control, but their passion for each other forces them to reach a compromise. All in all, Come Monday is an awesome beginning to a promising series.GiannaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Come Monday,1269561600,6,6,5,1

"I was a little thrown by the review that called the vamps lovey and introspective. However, I decided to give it a try and really enjoyed this book. The main character is tough girl familiar with the streets who is believable. So many authors try for tough and fail, but this character rings true. The vampire mythology is well thought out and there is plenty of blood and violence. Yes, there is a bit of love but it fits in well. This is definitely not a vampire romance novel.

"The luck of the assignment draw pleases Mary Corbett as she chooses a sealed envelope containing an inventory job in her hometown of Boston.  In turn this allows her to spend time with her sister during the holidays.  However, when co-worker Tony Parker asks her to switch with him, the kind team player agrees especially since Tony has covered her in the past.Mary travels to the old Martine Louisiana plantation about a hundred miles north of Baton Rouge.  There she meets her co-curator Jack Windom, a person she once wanted to share a bed with but he rejected her overtures since he was engaged at the time.  To Mary's chagrin, she remains attracted to the married Jack.  Worse yet for Mary is the visions and nightmares that she begins to see of the previous owners, Jean-Pierre and Magdalene Larrusard, dead for well over a century.  Haunted by them, Mary tries to help find peace for Magdalene and herself.BLUE MOON is a fabulous contemporary gothic-like ghost story filled with action and growing suspense that hooks the audience into a one sitting read.  Mary is a compassionate individual that makes her the prefect foil for the star-crossed lovers who disturb her every breath.  Jack is a hero in every sense of the word.  The lead duo makes a great couple even though the resolution of his marriage is too simple.  The secondary cast adds depth ranging from voodoo to assignment swapping, which in turn provides additional insight into Jack, Mary, and the two ghosts.  When it comes to leading suspense tales C.D. Ledbetter is one of the better writers on the market today.Harriet Klausner",Well done paranormal romance,973900800,5,5,5,1

"H. Beam Piper didn't invent the parallel universes concept, but he did more than almost anyone else to popularize it.Piper's Paratime is an infinite band of parallel Earths, each splitting off as the result of a decision somewhere in history. The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H. Beam Piper at his best.",All good reads in the fine old tradition,1355011200,0,0,5,1

"When one of the wonderfully authentic characters in Brad Marlowe'sSleepwalker: The Last Sandmansays, ""...if I tell you and if you believe... your lives will never be the same again"" he means it! Hold on tight to your hat and your wits as Marlowe takes you for a wild ride on the roller coaster of his rich and effervescent imagination. The book will keep your mind whirling between its artfully described nightmares and its exhilarating and boisterous heroism, while it stops short of stimulating true nightmares. You'll be delighted to meet the character who proudly declares ""By the age of ten I had awakened myself from a dead sleep with laughter so often...that my mother took me to a psychologist...""Fortunately you can read this delightful adventure by daylight or lamplight, unlike the magical Book of Dreams that holds the bones of the main story and can only be read by starlight.  Marlowe is a first rate storyteller who intertwines adventure and fantasy with thought provoking revelations. Sprinkled judiciously throughout the book are brief supporting stories which will equally delight and enlighten.While ""Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman"" sits comfortably in the same niche as the works of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, Marlowe holds true to his own unique creative vision. I think you'll agree with me that Marlowe delivers  ""...a happy ending that gives me exactly what I want, but in a way that I never expected.""

This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.

"I ordered this cover at the same time I ordered the Kindle DX.  It is very well made and I think it will last a lot longer than some other cases I ordered for my other gadgets.  This case was specially made by Amazon for the Kindle DX.  You have to insert the two metal tabs on the case to the spine on the Kindle.  This is rather delicate to do but can be done easily if you don't try to rush and force the tabs into the two holes in the spine. The instructions make it clear to insert the bottom tab first.I did not see until later, the other reviews about these tabs putting pressure on the Kindle's spine causing it to crack.  I just checked my Kindle and it seems to be set securely into the tabs without any pressure on the Kindle.  I am thinking this problem might occur if someone opened the back cover first having placed the Kindle on a surface upside down.  Opening this back cover does seem to put more stress on the Kindle spine. Right now I am giving this five stars.  If I have problems I will update this post with a lower rating and explanation.Update:  It is now 18 May 2014 and nearly two months since the above post.  I have absolutely no problems with this cover.  It works perfectly.  Just make sure you don't try to open it by the back cover.  You will feel resistance is you do this and I am sure this will break or bend the tabs holding the book in the cover.  This also means you have to be careful if you lend the book to someone.  I could be wrong about this danger but I do not want to test my claim.  I use this product daily.",One of the best made Covers I have seen for the price,1395360000,0,0,5,1

"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesAbby Brooks was expecting a relaxing few days while borrowing her best friend Kaitlyn's home but that's not what she gets. First she thinks she sees a large dog streaking through the snow-covered yard. Then, she can't find the spare key where it is supposed to be, so has to break in. Then upon entering the house she is attacked and accused of being a burglar. It sure doesn't help matters any that the man holding her is the most gorgeous man she has ever seen!Gabriel Hawthorne is at Kaitlyn's house installing a security system when he captures an intruder. He is surprised when she turns the tables and attacks him, saying he's the interloper. Even more surprising is the fact his wolf discovers the little spitfire is his mate! She is human though and Gabriel does not like or trust humans. How can she be his mate? As the two are snowed in together, passion burns bright and the wolf learns Perception is everything.Perception may take place during winter, but the heat Gabriel and Abby generate is enough to melt even the deepest of snow! Passion is fast, hot, and bright once the sparks between our lovebirds start flying. Gabriel is all alpha male, his wolf nature coming out, hard as a rock if he has to be yet willing to do anything to make Abby his, even in spite of his doubts about a relationship with a human. The sexual tension between them skyrockets, and when they come together, look out!Abby has a history but has made concerted effort to overcome her past and make a good respectable life for herself. Gabriel has no love for humans after the one he was closest to turned her back on him years ago so he swore never to get involved with a human again. Upon meeting Abby, his whole outlook on life begins to change and he realizes that there are humans in the world worth knowing and loving.Don't let the short length of Perception fool you. Patrice Michelle packs so much emotion into this story that you'll be wrung out by the end. She does a fantastic job of bringing her characters and their world to life so that we see them as real people, not just characters on a page.

"Amazon says that the charged battery on the Kindle 3 will last for up to a week with its radio on, and up to a month with its radio off. ""Up to"" is an elastic phrase. I have yet to get through one day without stopping to recharge. That means that having only one charger is a large nuisance, because I am then required either to stop reading for a while or to go read where the charger is. Therefore I keep chargers in several rooms. Soon I will be spending several days in the hospital, and of course I must take a charger cord with me. Hence the order for an additional one.By the way, I do not recommend accidentally stepping on your charger. Doing so resulted in damage to the electrical plug that made it necessary to discard that charger.When possible, I do prefer to buy Kindle accessories from Kindle, and I am annoyed that the batteries for the Kindle 1 must now be bought from a secondary source. Any dealer should continue to support a product for at least ten years after it is produced. I would also greatly prefer that Kindle return the memory card capacity, which was removed from the Kindle 2 and 3. Look, guys, some of us NEED extra memory.

Gabriel can see Charity as a good girl who deserves marriage the white picket fence and the whole nine yards but he is sure he isn't the man to give her those things because once she sees all of him she will run.

"""Demon's Night,"" by Guido Henkel, introduces the reader to the vividly supernatural world of Jason Dark and Siu Lin, ghost hunters extraordinaire. Dark brandishes a magical sword inside his cane, and Siu Lin draws upon her rich Chinese heritage to understand the forces of the paranormal, with some martial arts thrown in. (Though appealing, she is far from a fragile flower, and can hold her own in battle.) This highly atmospheric introductory volume is set in Victorian London, where a strange mist is killing people. And then there is this mysterious portrait of Paganini. Could the reader ask for more?Actually, yes; I was sorry when this rather short book ended. But otherwise Henkel knows what he is doing every step of the way.  He has a true gift for creating visual imagery.  Reading ""Demon's Night"" is like watching a movie.  The forces of evil are so graphically depicted that you can all but see them staring at you. Not only that, but the demon is given its own interior narrative, so that the reader sees the world through the single-minded demon's eyes. Yet the story is never overpowering. As a writer, Henkel finds just the right balance between the making the story believable and keeping the reader entertained. I had blissful dreams upon finishing the book.I wanted to see the relationship between Jason and Sui Lin develop, but presumably I will have to read future volumes to get my wish--which will be my pleasure to do. I also look forward to playing tourist again in Victorian England, which seems the ideal setting for the series, and which setting the author captures so adroitly. Need a spooky fun in your life? By all mean check out this series. You won't be disappointed.Jon P. Bloch(The Kindle Book Review)",A Supernatural Thing,1330560000,0,0,4,1
"I had a hard time at first getting into the story, for some reason I felt a little lost. I didn't feel like I understood exactly where Haven (the town the story takes place) was or why it was so different from the other places and why was a psychiatrist acting as a thief? What was the purpose behind it? Is this story set in the future?Thankfully it didn't take long for these questions to be answered and for the story to pick up. In fact once it did I had a hard time putting it down. I wanted to learn more about Alexia and how her mind worked and why she did the things she does and of course, I loved trying to figure out who the real thief was. I have to admit, I didn't see who the culprit was coming. I love a book that can stump me.Overall I really enjoyed reading this and thought it was very well written.

They talked about the one woman leaving the ranch with her brother in law and  leaving her kids behind, so that kind of took care of that aspect of it. But the writing was great and had me hooked from the beginning. I have read this over and over and loved it just as much each time. Tucker is more in love with Micah than he realizes and is just wanting to keep Micah from making a mistake in thinking he has a crush,but Micah knows he is in love and has been in love with Tucker for as long as he has been on the ranch. The marriage of convenience that Tucker thought up to save the ranch was brilliant on his part. He now has the ranch and Micah. There for a while you just dont know if Tucker plans to leave and break Micah's heart all over again. The angst makes it well worth the read and in my opinion there could have been more.

"A few days ago I ranted about writing love scenes in a bland, cliche fashion--throbbing members, cream, tight sheaths, etc. Well in Bite of Silence you won't be getting that. Indeed  Hughes writes scintillating, love making scenes, with a light touch.  There is no typical nookie here! If there is any issue with the book it is the titanic dimensions of the immortal Spartan in Twyla's dreams. his hand spanned her entire back.  And, the size of certain parts of his anatomy defy all logic (In Young Frankenstein, Inga, played by Teri Garr,  calls it a Scwann Schtucker).There is quite a bit of character development, and both Twyla and Nikos have been dealt a surprising depth and in Nikos' case an unexpected degree of sensitivity. The plot is improbable, maybe a bit silly. But for a light, lively read I recommend this. I know I had been debating over the past year  whether to get Biting Nixie, from the same author.

"A Hardboiled Murder, an Annie Underhill Mystery. Michelle Ann Hollstein  writes a story of grandmothers, movie stars, grandsons, a marine, a police officer, an adulterer, a murder victim, an inscribed piece of jewelry, a spurned wife, and a tramride up the side of a mountain during fall foliage season. This is a breathtaking ride that involves a dead body falling from the roof of one of the tram cars. It involves a search on foot through the woods on the side of the mountain, with treacherous cliffs unseen in the dark. It's a story of family devotion, family competitiveness between grandmothers, and a story of a marriage between ages. It's a story of a book group, a callous lover, and an anticipated inheritance. It is quite a cast of characters, each carefully described in the foreword of the book and each well developed through the actions of the story. It is a delight to read, and another five star story.","Good mystery, great setting",1349222400,33,33,5,1

"According to Twain, Heaven is years from earth, even when you are transported at .1 speed of light. It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

"This book had me from the very first page. From the very first time that I read an Arthurian tale I was hooked and have been searching for stories about Arthur and his times, this book does not disappoint. Cale is a great alpha who knows just what he wants and is not afraid to go after it. Sorcha is a strong willed and smart woman. As she struggles with understanding her feelings for Cale Sorcha rides a roller coaster of emotions and bring the reader along for the ride. The two play off of each other well and make a great couple. I loved the fierce determination of Cale and his unmoving faith in Sorcha and their love for each other. The bond of love and trust that these two form is a wonderful read.Sydney Somers knows how to pull a reader into the mystical world of shifters and magic, keeping you entertained all the way to the end.

Chase, but well, sometime it's good to forget that there are places in this world where you can't really be who you are without worrying of the consequences, and it's important to tell the story as you would like it to be, since maybe, time over time, you will change a mind at time.And so in this story we have Tyler and J.T., twin rodeo cowboys. Both handsome and gay (well actually, J.T. is bisexual...), J.T. is the shiny twin, while Tyler is the shy one. Tyler is also the responsible one, first his mother on her death bed and then his father asked him to take care of his twin, and Tyler always acted as guardian angel. He also left his beloved ranch, and his beloved neighbor Ren, to follow his twin on the rodeo circuit. But eight years after, Tyler is wondering if it's not time to come back at home, J.T. or not J.T. on tow.At home there is not only is aging father, but also Ren, the older and handsome neighbor who was Tyler's unrequited first love. Tyler has never had the courage to confess to Ren his feelings, instead he talked to J.T. who, soon after, seduced Ren. Now Tyler doesn't know if being happy to have a proof that Ren is gay, or be unhappy to be forced once again to compete with his twin.On the other hand, Ren is only waiting for Tyler to be old enough, and tired enough of the outside world, to be ready to settle down in their ranches. Ren is the older brother of three, but his two brothers have no intention to stay at the ranch. So Ren is ready and willing to build a family, and Tyler was always is first choice when arriving to a life partner. His relationship with J.T. was only a fling, and something that tired him soon after the first encounter.Ren has some personality issues, a legacy from his military service during war time, and he needs to be in control in every moment. On the other hand, Tyler needs to let the control sometime, since he is always the reliable twin, the one who everyone expected to take the right decision. In this way, Ren and Tyler are perfect together, being Ren always the top in their relationship, and Tyler the willing bottom.So no problem in their relationship and no problem also outside their relationship: Tyler's father behaves like a old fashioned father, means that he only asks Ren's intentions toward his son, and he is more than happy when he is assured that they are honest; Ren's brothers are only waiting for their brother to find a partner in order to be able to move out of the ranch without worrying to leave their brother alone... Sure, there is no the time, or the chance, to see the behavior of who is not a strict relative, other than one of Tyler's friend, but the atmosphere of all the book is of a total acceptance of Ren and Tyler's love.Setting and details are very accurate, with few right positioned words, T.A. Chase gives the reader all the necessary details to be deeply immerse in the rodeo and breeding horse culture.",Bound by Love by T.A. Chase,1369612800,0,0,4,1

"Dylan Gennaro is a beta werewolf who spent years under a vicious alpha who enjoyed nothing more than hurting others.  It isn't until his friends and new home is threatened by Alan Matthews does he finally take a stand and kill his former pack leader.  Even now in is new home of Red Rock and under a much more kind alpha, Dylan is still pained by is inner scars from his previous life.  He does not just want to sit around and be taken care of by others but wants to help and be of use.Sasha Wallace watched as her mentor was savagely murdered and left with a few scars of her own but it's the ones that she can't see that hurt her more.  The citizens of Red Rock make her feel nervous and is under constant watch because of her magic.  One of the few that is able to calm and make her feel at ease is Dylan.  He saved her life and sees her as more than just a witch.  With every passing moment that they spend together, their attraction for one another grows.  But will Sasha stay in Red Rock long enough to explore her desire and feelings for Dylan or will she flee the moment she has repaid her debt?Dylan has been a character I've been interested in since the beginning of the series.  He is unselfish and will do whatever he can to help in the war with his former pack in Helena.  My only complaint is that I think he takes on too much of the blame.  He blames himself for what happen to Abby (story in Cry Sanctuary), her sister Brynn (story in Sanctuary Lost) and for the entire war.  It isn't until Sasha comes in that he finally takes a break from the self blame and his character becomes more than it has been.  He is not an alpha wolf but Sasha brings his wolf closer to the surface and I like that.  Sasha had been badly hurt and is terrified but with Dylan she is able to relax and feel safe and confident again.  There is some fight when it comes to admitting how she really feels (isn't there always?) but together, they begin to heal each others wounds.  I think what I like most about their relationship is that Dylan isn't dominate like an alpha would be toward his mate.  Not that there aren't protective instincts in him and he does want it known she is his, its just since he is more gentle with her the relationship is more charming and sweet than the ones in the previous books.Their relationship isn't the only event going on in the book.  It is brought to everyone's attention that there is an evil vampire working against them in the war.  Dylan and Sasha along with Joe and Brynn are sent to seek help from a vampire friend of Red Rock's alpha Gavin that lives in Maine.  When they get there they see that the pack has their own crises they are dealing with that includes an alpha trying to take over the pack and a female vampire that has an eye out for the blood and power inside of Brynn.  It was good to see Joe and Brynn again.  I enjoyed reading their story in Sanctuary Lost and I like to see my favorite characters make an appearance.  Brynn suffered a lot in the previous book and I liked that her and her struggle were included in this book.  I think I would have been a little disappointed if it wasn't.This book has a bit of everything.  Action, romance, steamy love scenes and sarcasm which is always one of my favorite things to read.  Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Rogers' Red Rock series and is so far my favorite.  Each book is better than the one before and I have yet to be disappointed by anything from them.  I'm addicted to their characters, story and the world they built.  I can't wait for the the next installment in the Red Rock Series, Sanctuary Unbound.  Two words, lumberjack vampire.

"Quinn and Libby McKay had been together for fourteen years, but for the last three months, Libby had been living by herself after kicking her husband out.  She couldn't go on the way they had been.  They were no more than roommates, and she decided to either shake things up, or let go and move on.  It had truly shocked her that he seemed to take it in stride until he saw her dancing with someone else one night at Ziggy's.  Quinn had lost his temper, and that gave her some hope, but when he walked away not wanting to cause a scene, she was ready to give up.When Quinn showed up at the library waiting at her car, Libby didn't know what to think.  Hearing him ask for a second chance, and his proposition that she spend a weekend alone with him, she didn't know what to think.  Libby was further surprised to hear his agreement that he would give her time to think after their time together that was uninterrupted and free from pressure.  They had been so far apart from each other the past year that Libby was afraid to get her hopes up.  Knowing this was their last chance, she skeptically agreed.This was a different spin in that we witness the demise of a good marriage between two basically kind hearted people.  They allowed other issues come between them, and instead of tackling them head on, they tried to deal with them alone separating them farther.  Can these two find the path back to each other?

"Cliff Black's stories about the southwest Four Corner area are mesmerizing and toughly realistic. This area, filled with mysteries about the Ancient People is abundantly rich, with day to day real life struggles liberally sprinkled in.A myriad of thoughts torment the character's minds and the author cleverly burns nagging details into their psyches, details that refuse to leave.This is a beguiling mystery that turns a bit wild, stressing the protagonist, Daniel Corbin, just enough to gloss over his underlying paranoia.The reader can easily get enmeshed in local history, or enjoy being introduced to varied native tribal information.Black always presents well plotted tales that move at a good pace. And, Daniel Corbin proves to be a believable investigator.Many years ago, I too was attracted to test haunting mystic of The Ancient Ones, the Pueblo Indians and The Cliff Dwellers. This novel renewed that curiosity.The Trickster stories and the Coyote legends stir imaginations. The Jicarilla Apache background ties a connection cord between the reader and this area.

"It was a good book, though I got confused when all of a sudden his affections seemed to change. As we start reading, I thought that he was going to go with Darla, the panther shapeshifter. He was talking about how he had watched over her, and was starting to get a little hot and bothered since there were no owl shapeshifters in the area. And I for one love that owl's were featured instead of the typical werewolves or panthers. I think that was my favorite part of the book. I'm glad he ends up with another owl shifter, but it still sure was confusing.There were some things here and there that seemed odd, not to mention them getting straight to business, if you know what I mean, the same day they meet. A bit fast, but then you could blame it on the animal side.

Also, that the rest of the cast of characters could have been expounded on to make the story more engrossing.

"I downloaded this for my Kindle not knowing what to expect.  It just sounded like an interesting book.  I really ended up enjoying this book a lot.  It is a very classic fantasy tale with a lot of humor woven throughout.Wistril and his apprentice, Kern, live in Castle Kauph and in general just want to be left alone to their studies.  In these three stories about Wistril, that is just not meant to be. The three stories included are Wistril Besieged,Wistril Afloat, and Wistril Betrothed.  In each story Wistril shows that brain always triumphs over brawn and comes up with humorous solutions to rather difficult situations.I thoroughly enjoyed these stories.  Wistril is a pretentious, yet caring and hilarious wizard.  He constantly surprises the reader with his crazy solutions to problems.  Kern is a very competent apprentice who weaves tons of hilarious sarcasm throughout the novel.  Wistril is sworn, as a white wizard, to never harm with his magic and this adds an interesting twist to things.Tuttle has a very readable writing style that I really enjoyed.  He develops wonderfully quirky characters.  These stories really have a classic kind of tongue-in-cheek dungeon crawling humor to them.  I was pleasantly surprised and very amused.Overall I absolutely loved this book.  I immediately went online and got a couple more of Tuttle's Kindle books.

"This book has shown up in my Amazon 'recommended for you' list for years, and I have always ignored it.  I also wondered why it was suggested.  I'm not normally in the habit of purchasing books about pet fetishes.  But I have purchased every book by Maren Smith and Denise Hall, which I now understand are also names that Darla Phelps publishes under, and I have loved almost every one of those books so I decided to give this a try.  And when I finished this in a few hours - quickly purchased books 2 and 3 (gotta love the BUY button on the Kindle). A previous reviewer suggests you will never look at your pet the same and I agree.  You may never look at any animal the same!  These books have plenty of the stuff that makes Maren Smith and Denise Hall some of my favorites.  With the added bonus that there is a great plot and the story telling is excellent.  These are not always present at the same time with books in this genre.  I can't believe I waited to so long to read these - but at the same time it was a delicious treat to 'discover' them at a point when it seems really good books are harder and harder to come by in this genre.",Give this one a try,1308096000,3,3,5,1

"A sardonic parody of spy adventures, that isn't predictable at all.  There are so many twists and turns in this story that it is almost impossible to predict the author's next move, leading to the conclusion with with a Keystone Kops type scene.  You will want to pay attention to the characters as they are introduced, because you never know when or where they will show up again, and what their role in this story actually will become.Enjoyable, but a bit tedious in details at times.  Maybe the mind numbing details were intended to be red herrings to divert the reader's attention so the next twist is even a larger surprise.

"Alma Owens narrates a very interesting picture of life in the days without running water, indoor plumbing and having baby after baby and loving each and every one of them (the children, not the hardships).  Its written in a way that if you close your eyes and listen to her words you feel as though she is speaking just to you, regarding her life when times were very very hard. Not driving she had a very limited means of getting around places until she was older and then she learned to drive.  Her husband was not encouraging in her getting out and about on her own, and in some way, not real supportive, but that was the way men were in those days.

"I think a lot of romance authors forget to set up the background to the story and the reader misses out on a lot.  The prologue doesn't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book, it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature, and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words.  Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell.  Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die.  Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there.  Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now.  Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it.  Geyron could not help, even though he desperately wanted to.  In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer, one she would later realize was a mistake.  While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords, Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings, desires, and wants for one another.  This is where it starts to get messy.  The Demon Lords have begun to truly destroy the wall.  Without revealing too much I will say that in the end all the Demon Lords are stuck in Pandora's Box.All in all I really enjoyed this The Darkest Fire.Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog.",Fairytales4grownups.com Review,1335052800,1,1,4,1

"BLIND MALICE by Annis Ward Jackson is the third of the Rachel Myers Murder Mysteries that I have read. Since I read the other two out of order, I went back and started at the beginning.  Rachel Myers is a very appealing character because of her dedication to everything she does, and she is a very kind and moral person.  Coming from the mountains of North Carolina, a beautiful area of the country, she is used to making her own way in the world and also is used to hard work.  At the beginning of this series, she is a nursing administrator for a retirement home in Flagstaff, AZ.In this novel, Rachel has returned from Arizona, where she now lives, to her father's farm in North Carolina to attend his funeral. He had suffered a heart attack and was found in his home by Isaac, an old friend of her father's who lives on the farm property and helps with the work of the farm and kept her father company.  It comes to Rachel's attention that another friend of her father's from the past had become very interested in her father and his farm and had talked him into making some improvements on his property that weren't really necessary, and that had cost much more than Rachel's father would normally spend.  In addition to everything else, the housekeeper that Rachel's father had had for years, was now fired and gone. Something just wasn't right.When Rachel and Isaac together find out some other suspicious facts, Rachel knows that it is time to find out the truth about her father's estate, both the property and the money, and why certain things just aren't adding up.  Isaac is a great support to Rachel as she tries to find out what went on during the time since her last visit home.The descriptions of the North Carolina scenery on the trails that Rachel rides her horse on and of the mountains around the farm are a delight to read about, and are authentic since the author is a native of North Carolina.There is suspense, mystery and pleasant times with old friends in BLIND MALICE.  Now that I've read this one, it's on to another in this series.  These are very enjoyable mysteries.",A very pleasant mystery,1323302400,1,1,4,1

"Joseph Boyden seems incapable of telling a narrative story from start to finish; rather he jumps around from the present to various points in the past moving his point of view from person to person. Makes for challenging reading. If you're up for the challenge he tells a cracking good story. After working on this book for half a decade it finally clicked last night. Set in Moosonee and various points south it is filled with the usual references to alcohol abuse, residential schools, and living off the land.  If you hadn't guessed his subjects are Anishinabe and no attempt is made to varnish the hardships, pride, and challenges of their lives.

"This is the third book in the Out of Uniform series. I really enjoyed this story a lot. I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as the second one because that's how the first one was. It was better, but I was wrong. I still think that the second book is going to be my favorite one, but this one is right up there. I do suggest that you read this series in order because then you don't get disappointed or confused. I know that you don't have to read them in order, it's just a good idea. I loved how the character Holly from the second book came up with the idea of playing his girlfriend to show that he did have other options instead of waiting for Mackenzie to realize that he wasn't like all the other guys she's dated. I had high expectations for this book after reading the second one and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed at all!

"Nothing better than a rip roaring family stand-off to spice up weekend reading. Luc father, Maurizio is a dinosaur hell-bent on his version of Greek tradition being honoured, though he himself is far less honourable in his methods.Luc is gutted by his brother's  and father's betrayal of his love for Skye, not to mention the son they hid from him and comes in guns blazing to a blistering, scorching confrontation with Maurizio. And bluntly defies his family to woo back the love of his life and their son.Lots of layers to unpeel, more blistering showdowns for this family to work their way through. I love this alpha male, prepared to defy and dis-own his Greek family to put Skye and Matt first. And I love that Skye makes Luc earn the right to her trust and love but she also grows to understand the tenacious pride of culture and traditions, despite being far from home.Very satisfying - one of the few novels to survive another culling from my library.",I adore the epic family dynamics,1402963200,0,0,5,1

A group is put together to try and save what may be the end of the world as they know it.

"Savannah Marshall can't believe how easily she managed to stake the vampire! But why isn't he dying? After all, as a recent graduate of the Holy Order of St. Vlad, Savannah knows all the tips to slaying vampires. Vampire Donatello Demarcus Ravell will have to convince Savannah that he's actually a good vampire or all of humanity may be (forgive the pun) at stake. Does love stand a chance between a vampire and a slayer?J. Morgan has a wickedly clever sense of humor that infuses every single page of LOVE AT FIRST STAKE. Readers will relish the pop culture references that pepper the storyline and I still giggle just thinking about a couple of them. The Britney Spears scene is just classic! Humor, romance, and the paranormal are perfectly meshed together to create a storyline that simply begs for a series!Savannah is a phenomenal heroine. She's snarky, stylish, and gutsy. Her brand of vampire slaying is hysterically funny as she adds just the right touch of absurdity to such a bloodthirsty occupation. Donatello, or Donnie as she calls him, is the ideal complement to Savannah. He's much more serious but even he can't resist Savannah's allure.J. Morgan has been a favorite author of mine ever since I stumbled onto his work during an author chat on a yahoo group. I've been hooked ever since then as his brand of snarkiness would impress even MaryJanice Davidson. If you haven't tried a book by J. Morgan, LOVE AT FIRST STAKE is a wonderful place to start.

Greg and his wife Jill visit Israel and the mid-east where a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase what appears to be an old scroll and she tucks it in her carryon.

"Not Just For Breakfast Anymore PV LundqvistA boy and his pet overcome being the new kids on the block and learn many laudable lessons.I don't know where to start, there were so many things I liked about this book.  This would have been entertaining if it had been a boy and his dog but a boy and his pig makes it much more interesting.Benny is so likeable because he is so normal.  He shows the fears and insecurities that are ubiquitous to human beings let alone children.  His parents are not perfect nor are they buffoons.The conflict is not violent but it is believable.  Bullying is a hot topic at the moment.  Lundqvist paints a more realistic approach than many authors.  He also show the impact a negative family life can have on creating bullies without in any way becoming preachy.The friendship between Major and Benny and the impact reality has, particularly in hard economic times, is poignant.  All of us have been there at some point in our lives.So many laudable characteristics are exhibited that it would be tedious to list them all.  Lundqvist painted real live people, showing emotions and empathy as well as pettiness and anger.  Fletcher is icing on the cake.

"This novel is frightening, poignant, intelligent, and disturbing. I couldn't possibly be more impressed. The first thing I should say is this: the author had many opportunities for this story to become tedious and boring with too many facts; after all, she has 'built' a world war (based on realistic ideas that are plaguing the world as we sit at our computers right now). But this story never became tedious or boring. I found myself marveling at the brilliance of this writer to give so much detail and still keep it interesting and moving forward. There was a major risk of alienating readers with the continuing build up of what was going on around the world with the Islamist movement, but it just built up more suspense and dread as the story moved along.It is written in the first person - a challenge on its own, especially in such a detailed and driven story. The main character is engaging and human and it is impossible not to root for her at every stage. Something that I truly appreciated throughout the story was the connection between the main character and Ann Frank. At first I thought Francisco would have a difficult time making a clear and useful connection with Ann Frank, but my concern was proven wrong. This connection was deeply important and gives much meaning to the story. It is another world war, and the main character is very human, lonely (even though she is always surrounded by people), driven to care about others and her family, and the main character is somewhat nave, just as Frank would have been, considering her age.I found several quotes from the novel to be compelling: ""I wonder why it is no one ever seems to learn lessons from history, particularly from war"" (Francisco). Another important quote is: ""War restricts choice. Restricted choice makes love fiercer, more precious. War makes love worth dying for, love makes it possible to fight"" (Francisco). These two quotes show a truly profound understanding of the meanings behind this story. A third quote states: ""Someday we will tremble in horror at the tens of thousands of innocent Muslims who have been killed. Now it only feels necessary and inevitable."" When we consider what is taking place around the world in regard to Muslim thoughts and how Christians (and other religions) feel about Muslim thoughts, it is a chilling realization that one day we will look back and wonder how we could have considered certain actions to be 'okay' and even necessary, in the name of security... just like there are many Germans who wonder how they could have given approval to the Holocaust at the time, and how people during all wars justified the inevitable devastation all in the name of their beliefs - even though they were justifying the deaths of innocents. In sum, this novel makes you think about what we are willing to say 'okay' to... this novel will leave the reader chilled and deeply embroiled in self-contemplation regarding what we are willing to do and approve of for our beliefs.I eagerly await the next novel by this clearly gifted writer!!!",2012 - Just the beginning!,1269129600,3,3,5,1

"Kilborn doesn't mince words, just body parts in this engrossing short story which picks up literally where Truck Stop left off. Donaldson's god complex, thirst for blood and need for complete victim submission come to fore in Serial at the expense of a naive hitchhiker. Kilborn teams Donaldson with yet another antagonist with a fetish for the macabre whose drive is that of the more imposing serial killer yet far more unassuming. Expect terror at every turn of the road.Serial delivers on its relentless pursuit to dissuade people of picking up hitchhikers - I will never look at charred meat on the BBQ the same again as I am sure to envision the vivid and overtly graphic scenes described in this story.

I love the larger 9.7 Kindle even though it is quite a bit heavier it has clearer print.  The larger page allows me to read an entire book page so I am not alway pressing the button to turn the page.  I have often lost the train of thought in the story by having to keep paging through because the smaller page doesn't hold as much print so the larger Kindle makes reading a lot more enjoyable.  I also have the smaller keyboard Kindle which is great but I like the 9.7 Keyboard Kindle even better.  The only improvement I would like to see is going back to the directional button with arrows rather than the teeny-tiny rectangular button to access the line menu.

Megan is traveling to the wedding of a cousin and has been asked to pick up another wolf at the airport; her sister's anchor, Shane Rosario. Megan doesn't think anything of it until she smells him and once that happens nothing can stop the two from mating.Shane Rosario denies the wolf inside of him.  Brought up by his mother to hate what he is, Shane never loses control and never changes.  When Megan Warden picks him up at the airport and Shane senses his inner wolf rumbling, he is shocked but goes with the flow.  One mating later, the two are at odds at their sudden relationship.Shane refuses to give up his medicine and life in Las Vegas.  Megan can't imagine living outside of her pack.

I was actually wondering if something had gone wrong with Ms. Forster's writing abilities. But then it all started to come together and became more interesting until I couldn't put it down. Shocking, yes! Surprising, yes! A major surprise ending. All in all, I gave Before Her Eyes 4 stars. I held one star back because of the beginning third which is why I really didn't feel deserved all 5 stars. It was the last two thirds of the book that truly made the book exciting to read.

"About a year ago in Chicago, writer Emerson Ward saw the twenty-three years old waif look in trouble so he took her to his home and was nice to her while Ellen Forrester regained her equilibrium before she finally left after five days there.  Now her father Larry arrives in a rage accusing Emerson of seducing his daughter and tries to kill him, but fails.  Apparently Ellen has run away again.A week later while Emerson and his girlfriend Nell ponder what to do about her pregnancy, Larry's former wife Audra Campbell asks him to find her missing daughter.  Reluctantly he agrees because he feels a certain knight in shining armor mentality towards the lass.  He starts at her private school, which leads to her friends and soon he learns she was pregnant but when he finds her she is dead.  Emerson refuses to quit as he now needs to know who killed her.This is an intriguing investigative tale as the hero is unable to stay on the sidelines following twisting clues where they take him to include violent encounters at abortion clinic and a strange weave involving the Catholic Church.  The story line is action-packed beginning from the moment that an apparently very accurate shooter misses seven times (hitting Emerson's newly finished table, etc.) and never slows down as the sleuth follows a meandering trail that climaxes with a fabulous final spin.  Fans will appreciate this solid murder mystery.Harriet Klausner",intriguing investigative tale,1144972800,3,3,5,1

"I read this short story because of its authors. Both are great authors and the story had potential. Unfortunately, while a good read, it doesn't live up to its full potential.A driver picks up a hitchhiker. Kills him. A hitchhiker is picked up by two stoners and kills them. Third chapter: The serial killers meet and all hell breaks loose.Except that hell is a little bit predictable. But graphic.I had to read the story twice. I didn't read the description or advance marketing copy before beginning the story so I was not prepared for the POV shift in the second chapter. It confused me until I went back and read it again. The cliffhanger from the first chapter appears to lead in to the second chapter quite naturally, but the POV shift was a shocker until I understood how the authors collaborated and who wrote each part. After that, the story made better sense. That's probably my fault for not reading the promos.Still, the writing is not completely terse. There are parts of it that can be tightened. Adverbs where none are necessary. Sentences that could have been shorter. But these are nitpicks. The plot and story line are actually decently implemented.The problem is the authors could have spent a little more time on the collaborative effort in chapter three to make it more unpredictable. Some of the characterization is a little flat even for a short story. Otherwise, I'd say it was a decent read.Doesn't quite deserve four stars, but it's better than three stars. Probably more like a 3.8.","Interesting Concept, Mediocre Delivery",1325116800,0,0,4,1

"William sent me a copy of this book, my very first ever request to review, so I'm honoured and delighted to do so!  Now I'm an anti-Harry Potter sort of person, so when I saw an amulet was involved I was a little wary. I also come from a completely different writing culture. I needn't have worried!  William has the gift of writing , well what I'd call young adults stories, though anyone could read this and be blessed. He has that knack which pulls you into the perspective of Brian, and tells the tale from a child of his age's point of view. The whole text has for me that wonderful fairytale feeling that I love in the Elizabeth Goudge stories such as the Little White Horse.Brian is maybe old for his age due to the abuse he has suffered in his life but he also acts just like a teenager.  His journey to find the Living water is has great narrative tension and I'm glad that it went on long enough after the climax to make the ending balanced and it sort of ties in to the supernatural of the story.I began thinking, ok, so this is a magical story in many ways, just how would this appeal to any teenager?  Its adventure with a twist of romance, reality and excitement. Yet as a Christian, how is this tale justified. (see my standpoint above).  Of course William related this to the Native Americans, and has a bible verse. Then it hit me, maybe I'm being dense, and William  had this in mind but the whole book is one huge allegory or metaphor.  Come to me and drink the streams of living water (John 4, v 13-14) . As Christians, we all seek and drink the living water of Christ and our lives should then reflect and bless all around them. This is what Brian and Rachel did with their lives. It gives you the gospel message that through Christ we can be all things and bless others.  This book does it in a way acceptable to the teenage mind if they can see it!

"Tami Dee has a winner in Dawn of a Viking Sunrise. This is a book that once started, you will not be able to put down. The plot is very creative and imanginative. It's amazing how much detail is in this novel. At first, all the names and titles are a little hard to keep up with, but as you get into the story it all smooths out. The characters are wonderful. Rosalinda is a modern woman. The love she shows others is heart warming. As she travels through time, her reactions are believable considering every thing she goes through. Her big viking Davyn is the ultimate manly man. Being a man of the Dark Ages, some of his customs are barbaric. But as you get to know him you see he really has a heart of gold. The plot flows in many directions. You have bad guys, long lost sisters, misplaced cousins, and lots of friends old and new. I loved this book! It has it all -- humor, action, adventure, and romance.

The Lost Son is no exception to this rule and totally worth the read.Mr. Black's characters are strong, independent, and have a reckless streak I love. I felt immediately transported to the world Kalen and Micheil live in and didn't want to leave. The secondary characters add a distinctive flavor to the plot. They kept me guessing throughout and not wanting the story to end. And the ending...it's a short story, but it's very much worth it and exciting.Kalen is a typical warrior. He's a fighting man's man. But what I liked the best about him is that he's willing to say, `Hey, I made a mistake'. That takes guts. I also loved the idea that he loved as fiercely as he fights. He's the type of hero I want on my side in any confrontation. And the plot twists concerning his future--I didn't see them coming, but I loved them.As much as I liked Kalen, I liked Micheil. There were times when I wasn't sure about him, other than he needed and loved Kalen passionately. But when his true nature and role in the story were brought to light, I knew I liked him. In fact, I didn't want the story to end. He's as strong and unruly as Kalen, but with the added flavor of magical powers.If you want a story that will indeed stick with you long after the last page, then you need to read The Lost Son.

"Budding Magic by L S Fayne, the first book in the fantasy fiction series, is a wondrous and beautiful telling of the tale of the O'Byrne Daughters.  The children of Aine and Keegan O'Byrne have all inherited the magic that runs through their lineage; this novel explores their lives during and after the passing of their parents. The cover does not do justice to the content. It is a magnificent tale, which is wonderfully written.The title of main character is passed from parent to child and then shared by the daughters themselves, much like the magic running through the characters' veins.  Each character is painstakingly crafted with just enough description to create a vivid and elaborate image in the reader's mind of this beautiful portion of Ireland and its inhabitants.  This novel enfolds the reader in the tale and builds its world around each to place him or her at the heart of the story.  Fayne has created a storyline, and the telling there of, that not only gives the reader a front row seat to the happenings, but pulls each into the tale to feel and be transported by its words.The plot is highly developed and beautifully written. Each movement of the characters affects his or her surrounding landscape as if Aine herself had charmed the very land.  The tale is straightforward, but far from plain.  Many writers would stumble trying to create such an intricate tale, but Fayne does so seemingly effortlessly and the reader is all the better for it.  From the Emerald Isles to the reader's hands, this is magic not to be dismissed.",Budding Magic by L S Fayne is Blooming Beautifully,1345334400,4,4,5,1

"Wonderful book. All of Kallysten's work that I have read as of yet as been wonderful.This one took me a bit to jump in, and get the bearing and surroundings for some reason. I had a cold for a bit, so maybe it was just that.Marc and Blake are vampires. Marc being the Master and Blake being his Childe. The setting is in the future when Pacts are no longer formed or mean much of anything. (Pacts are where vampires keep humans safe and in exchange they give vampires blood.)(To learn more about Pacts see Kallysten's series titled The Pact) Vampires used to keep humans safe from the demons that roam the earth. There seem to be more and more demons roaming, this is caused by rips in the reality. Marc and Blake are looking for the rip when they come across some human fighters who are in need of assistance. Of course humans nowadays aren't as trusting and fear that these 2 vampires might be working with the demons. so it takes some time before a little bit of trust is formed.Amongst the group of fighters is Kate, who both Marc and Blake find attractive and desire. Kate is slow to realize it, but she too has an attraction to not just one of them but both of them. Although there is ground work set for more with these 3, there isn't much in this book. (can't wait for the next one and the one after that, as it will be about these three, but back to this one first.) They fight together and the start to trust one another, and slowly build more of a foundation.The vampires and the humans main goal becomes to find the rip and get it sealed, so they move on to a new town and start once more. Slowly making earth a safe place once again. There is hurt, and some betrayal, and enough lust to make you want more. Once the story gets going, its hard to put down, it just seems to fly by and before you know it its over and your wanting the next book so you can continue on with their journey and see what more is to come.",Blurred Trilogy part of The Demon Age,1380412800,0,0,4,1
"Before I even ordered my Kindle, I read as much as I could about other user's experiences with it.

That was the right decision.I don't know what ""smell"" is being talked about, there's no odor to it at all that I can detect, and it provides just the right cover for my new best friend.

"Robyn Maxwell might be deaf but she and her family have not let that stop her.  She is a successful baker and outdoors woman.  But she just can't seem to find a man she wants to date.  She does need a break though and when her brother backs out of their annual trip into the wilderness she decides to go by herself.  What she doesn't' count on is meeting the two others who are there at the same time.  She meets Keil and his brother and is instantly drawn to Keil.Keil is in the process of fighting for alpha of his pack.  He and his brother are taking some time away from the pack to regroup.  Keil never expects to find his mate, and in a woman who doesn't even know she is a wolf.  Suddenly everything seems to be happening to him at once...  Not quite the relaxing time he expected.  Will Keil and Robyn mate?  Will Keil win the alpha challenge?Wolf Signs takes an interesting twist to the normal wolf meets girl story.  Robyn is unique as she is deaf.  I found the premise of this story fantastic.  I love to see ""non perfect heroines"".  There is great potential for this series as we meet many lovable characters in Wolf Signs.  The only thing that I didn't love while reading this tale was there were a few awkward sayings and I did think that Robyn took things a little ""too in stride"".  But others might not find fault with these issues.  Either way, I still think Wolf Signs and the Granite Lake Wolves Series are worth your while.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Wolf Signs,1256515200,47,47,4,1

As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII, I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save, I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust, but not all Polish people are evil.

"This story is the 3rd story in the Royal Cordova Trilogy but it's a complete stand alone as I imagine are the prior 2.  Prince Maximillian is 36 Years old and is a bachelor who has suffered through many of his mother's set ups and attempts to get him married off and churning out heirs to the throne.  Max has been pining after his assistant Tara, who is beautiful, capable and none the wiser he has the hots for her.  Tara also harbors romantic feelings for her boss but has managed to keep her feelings under lock and key. She believes the Prince could not possibly be serious about a commoner and she was destined for heartbreak when he eventually finds and marries his Princess.  Max realizes at a party when Tara is tipsy, that she is attracted to him and he sets about pursuing her and attempting to change her mind about their romance. The romance is more sweet than steamy and there were instances where I lost patience with Tara being so obtuse and clueless.  For someone who attended Harvard Business School a lot of interactions with Max's family went straight over her head.  She seemingly was unaware she was being vetted.  Despite that and some spelling errors and poor edits, this was still a decent read.",Light Romantic Story,1370044800,0,0,4,1

"I really did enjoy this story but much of it was less than stimulating reading.  The conversations were stiff and in my opinion didn't give the reader any sense of romance or passion.Louise is a wealthy and intelligent woman.  She hasn't met a man she could love in the manner of a wife for her husband.  And she thinks her fortune is her main attraction for men.  Her interests lie in engineering, a subject quite out of the norm for most women.She meets Lucas, a famous engineer and is immediately attracted to him.  However, he hears nasty things about her from a man he had known while at school.  Even though his mother and sister hold Louise in the highest of regard, he believes the tales and forbids his sister from continuing the friendship.He doesn't realize one of the major investors in his projects is Louise.  She uses the alias of Robert Adams because men wouldn't respect a woman's opinion in such matters.  Lucas eventually finds out he has gravely erred in his opinion of her, and that the man who spread malicious stories about her was a true villain.  It isn't long before he realizes he is in love with her.  She had acknowledged her feelings to him earlier, but that was the day he threw all the gossip about her back in her face.She never stopped loving him but thought he would never have a good opinion of her.Apparently this is based on a true story.  Perhaps the author didn't want to make it a warmer romance as these were two real individuals, but I would like to think their feelings for each other had a bit more passion.

"Having read the first Rachel Myers book, Blind Malice, and then skipping to Appalachian Trail Mix,the fifth book, I decided to go back and pick up with number 2.  Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge takes place while Myers is getting settled in the mountains after moving back from Arizona.  Jackson does a great job of combining the the everyday, seemingly thousands of little things that have to be done during a relocation, and the investigation of the death of Isaac Starling's best friend. I really relate to the Myers character as a real person; she's not  perfect, just someone who likes horses, likes gardening and doesn't mind getting her hands dirty doing real work. I'm not a big fan of flashbacks (there's one really long one) but Jackson handles it beautifully so the reader does not lose sight of the current story.  My own love of doing research in graduate school makes me admire Myers' determination to leave ""no stone unturned"" to find the killer.

"ReviewDove is the Sheriff and along with the victim of a kidnapping, Tessa Bradley, they take you on a twist and turn journey from beginning to end. This book did have a couple of typos within it, but nothing major and the story is exquisite.The characters are all tortured souls, all dealing with their own demons and secret pain, and it makes this book so interesting, and this is aside from the main plot! The main plot is of Dove's friend Fritz, who is shot dead in his own store, and an ex-model from the big city (Tessa) is kidnapped. The story switches between two viewpoints. From following Dove on his determined path to find the killer and rescue the woman, with whom he has a 'feel' for and can sense along his journey, it changes to Tessa's own words as she struggles to find her own path to self-forgiveness, battling her own demons and finding her way home. I could foresee a couple of the story lines, but most of them were well woven and did not give up the secrets till near the end, and the final piece of the puzzle was so well hidden I was shocked!I don't lie spoiler reviews but I have to say - read this book, it's well worth it, if I could have given it higher than 5, I would have.Dove is a hero, a tortured bear of a man who was a great character to delve into, and Tessa haunted me after the last page.I shall be reading more of Forster's work in the near future.

"I said in my review of the first book (Prophecy: Child of Light (Vampires Realm)) that it was a good thing I liked the characters and overall story enough to buy this, the second book, otherwise I'd have been ticked, as the cliffhanger that ended that first book had been so huge that it left me feeling the story was incomplete -- yes even for a book that is part of a series.  As if to prove my point, this book picks up almost right where the first book had left off.  Unlike some books that are parts of a series there is no recapping of the prior book.  I literally went from reading one book to the other and felt as though all I'd done was moved on to the next chapter.  So make no mistake, these are not stand alone books.This one starts with Prophecy on the road with Venturi, the guard who had been standing next to her at the end of book one.  They're off to find Valentine.  And, of course, they still need to figure out this whole prophecy thing so they can save the world.  Along the way we once again meet the three witches, Elena, Mathias, Kalinor, Arkalus, and some of the others from book one.  And, oh, we meet who appears to be the oldest vampire!  There's battles to fight.  Deaths.  More questions.  And yes, even some answers.  Sorry, that's all I say.  I'd not want to spoil it for you.I gave the first novel 3 stars.  Primarily because of two things:1) I'd felt the author was at a loss for words at times.  Repeating herself often enough to frustrate me.2) The feeling, as I said, of it not being a completed book.This book, is definitely better and so I'm giving it 4 stars.  There were still a few times when I felt as though I'd seen that same expression or word a few times too many, but the writing in that sense is greatly improved in this book.  Also, I did feel as though this story had a completed adventure even as it left us on an cliffhanger that will surely lead to an even bigger battle in the third book.I have decided to move ontoProphecy: Dark Moon Rising (Vampires Realm).  Whether I continue on  with Vampires Realm after that, we'll see.  But for this Prophecy trilogy aspect, I don't see how you can start it and not finish.",Better than the first,1269907200,5,5,4,1

Lachlan's brothers tease him as how tenderly Hunter carried him from the battlefield to the safety of Evermyst as if they were lovers.  Even though he resents owing anyone anything, Lachlan, vowing to pay his debt, wants to thank the warrior who probably saved his life.In 1536 Lachlan still owes the Hunter, who rejects everything the Rogue Fox offers.  Lachlan has become intrigued with the warrior and swears he will learn the secret of this great fighter.  When he does uncover the secret he is shocked beyond belief, but beginning to understand his fascination with the Hunter while he observes the warrior talking with an enemy while evil stalks Evermyst.THE WARRIOR BRIDE may be the strongest of Lois Greiman's Scottish romances as the cast makes for quite an exciting tale.  The Hunter is a wonderful warrior with secrets that will surprise the audience.  Lachlan is obsessive to make remittance to his savior until he uncovers the secret and changes his obsession.

"This book was a recent Kindle Daily Deal and I decided to take a flyer on it. While I like anthologies, ones as topical as this one aren't what I usually read. So I had my doubts about how I'd like it.But the gamble paid off well; I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. The stories range from touching to humorous. While I'm usually not a fan of 'country humor' (who can compare to Twain?), the humorous stories in this book weren't bad. The non-humorous ones were pretty good.Even though I wasn't raised in the South, all of my extended family was and many of these stories reminded me of my childhood when I used to spend time there.","If you don't bet, you can't win",1341187200,2,2,5,1
"The title for this review reflects the considerable influence that the Tom Swift series has had on science and technology n America. Visionaries like Steve Wozniak and Issac Asimov have cited it as part of their inspiration, and it was certainly part of mine when I was growing up (I went into math and physics as fields).The series is regarded as ""edisonade"" in character, that is, using inventors like Thomas Edison as the basis for the fictional character. The books, at least in the initial series which began in 1910, featured inventions and technology that had been or was close to being realized. The later Tom Swift series became more fantastic in tone. Many of he books are now in the public domain, but the character is still continuing (owned by Simon and Schuster, I believe), and a feature film was announced in 2008.The Tom Swift books were written in four different series. The books ncluded in this collection (26 of them) were from the first series and appeared in 1910-1932 and 1939. The last two books shown appeared in 1962. Their author, Victor Appleton or Victor Appleton II, was actually the pseudonym for a variety of different authors.My rating reflects the reverence that I have for my own memories of reading these books as a boy. At the time, I enjoyed them immensely. However, that was many, many years ago.hen I perused this particular collection, it was clear that the Tom Swift series was not aging very gracefully, and the technology being described doesn't hold the interest as well as it once did. Still, the books serve as a good source for insight into the beginnings of American science fiction.Anyone purchasing this particular edition should also be prepared for some poor formatting. The text is run together without proper breaks, and headings are not centered. The overall effect was so distracting that I finally returned the content to Amazon for a refund. Please consider that many of the Tom Swift novels in this collection are available as free Kindle editions. Rather than spend your money on this edition, you might check out the free ones to make sure you really want to spend your money to get all these works at once.",A great (but partial) set,1321315200,1,1,4,1
"I once owned the Ace versions of these 3 tales and I enjoyed them when I first read them, gosh, about 50 years ago!  I was happy to be able to re-read them now and, for a little while, recapture my childhood. We all know they are not great literature, but we also know they will provide us with a few hours of pure escapist entertainment. Kline was never as good as Edgar Rice Burroughs, but when you ran out of ERB, Kline was there to help fill the void. This is a very fairly-priced set inasmuch as others are selling the books separately for as much or more. My 5-star rating may be a little inflated--Kline is certainly no Charles Dickens--but I think some earlier reviews were meanspiritedly low. Believe me, you will receive more than a buck's worth of entertainment.",Brings back memories,1330905600,3,3,5,1

"For a first novel, I found this a pretty good read. There are 3 story lines that are well done and come together at the end. There is also a traitor in the midst of things, which keeps the suspense up.I really only found a few minor typos, so I did not find any of these distracting.Now, the women DO get pretty badly abused, except for one feisty gal. But, if you ever watch what happens in some of the lawless countries in Africa, or from some of the abuses women take in some Arab countries, it was totally believable.I did find the language a bit more 'formal' than I was used to, but I attributed that to this being by an author from the South. (We aren't nearly so polite here in the NorthEast!). It reminded me a bit of the style of the old western novels.I enjoyed reading the book, and found it more realistic than most of the self-published novels I've found so far.",Pretty good for a first novel,1268956800,15,15,4,1

"As in the first book, the world building is riveting and all the stories were interesting and well written. I noticed though a few mistakes that should have been caught by a proofreader and it's a bit unexpected by this publisher. Here we go:Trust Me by Astrid AmaraBrian is now a hell cop. He is more or less a rookie. His osmotic abilities - he can draw energy from other living creatures and discharge it to heal or maim - are getting out of control, causing unwanted damage to those around him. At first it seems he doesn't want to handle them and he's unwillingness causes trouble with his boyfriend Jay, the hell cop detective who can't stop burning. The problems get worse when Brian is accused of killing a suspect in custody, since the death came through the draining of the suspect's energy.In the previous book Brian was a sunny, naive character, but this time he shows a darker side that I think doesn't depend solely on his uncontrollable abilities. The whole story takes a darker turn, because the mystery under investigation is about a terrible act that makes you feel sorry for the criminals.I liked reading about Jay's feelings toward his family, how he feels isolated because he can't be included either to comfort or be comforted by them. It was also interesting to read how torn he felt for having to be separated from Brian and making him suffer because he risked of being hurt by him. They fear they won't manage to patch up their problems, especially because their abilities keep them apart from anyone else and without each other they face isolation and loneliness.In this story the world building is at its best.Dark Waters by Nicole KimberlingThis time this is my favorite couple, the half-demon professor Michael and hell cop Argent. I loved reading how they tried to reconcile their differences or how they decided to avoid or embark on arguments.Invited by one of his students, Michael goes to a sort of trailer park to research a faun ceremony, and Argent goes with him on vacation. There's a feud going on between the fauns and the mermaids and murder happens. In order to allow Michael to interact with the fauns more freely, Argent doesn't reveal he is a cop and he does a bit of investigation on his own, also because the ceremony seems to hide a shady and dangerous ritual.Since Michael is a demon himself and works in an organization devoted to bring peace between humans and demons, he often disagrees with the hell cops' methods. He would also like for Argent to drop his shields when they're together, to allow Michael's telepathy to know his lover better. Even if they often fight, it's clear that what they feel for each other is deep and humor often defuses the tenser arguments.It was really a pleasure to read.Such Heights by Ginn HaleThis was for me the best case of the three. James is a young human photographer and Moran is his hell cop lover. When we meet them, they're relationship seems rocky. Moran is afraid that James will get seriously hurt while working one of his cases, because his natural curiosity puts him in a lot of danger. James knows that Moran is protective because in his past he lost someone he loved, but he wants the older man to understand that they both have dangerous professions and James just wants to do his job.After one of their fights and after being given a sort of ultimatum, James reaches a suspended palace where phoenixes live in order to film a documentary, but he doesn't tell Moran. James witnesses the fall of a guest from the palace, a fall denied by the palace owner and his security guards, but the man falls to the ground and Moran is the designated detective. While James stirs all kind of trouble trying to find out what's going on, Moran reaches the palace undercover and when the estranged lovers meet, they have to investigate together one more time.There are a few misunderstandings between James and Moran, but it takes a while for them to realize that they're expressing the same concern for each other. I liked reading how they reached their compromises and how both their disagreements and their reconciliation were expressions of the deep love they feel. The age gap theme so prominent in the previous book was not explored here, even if James has the enthusiasm of a young man trying to pursue his career of choice, unheeding the perils of it, and Moran has the maturity of the older man who knows how to retreat and how to advance and what the priorities in life are.Very good collection. I recommend reading the previousHell Copfirst in order to enjoy both the world building and the different stories better.",Riveting world building and very good writing,1346716800,1,1,4,1

"(cross posted from the blog Wading Through Electronic Ink)In Night Camp, Shane's parents are forcing him to go to summer camp, and in retaliation, he insists upon going to the strangest camp he can find - Night Camp, where campers sleep all day and explore the world at night. But soon after their arrival, Shane, his cousin Brad, and fellow camper Nicole begin to suspect that the people running the camp might be vampires.Overall I found Night Camp to be a cute and engaging story about the adventures of kids at a summer camp. It brought back lots of memories of my times at summer camp, and I found myself wishing that I too could have spent my summers living in a castle and exploring caves instead of the much more traditional cabins and canoeing that I remember. Of course, I was also grateful that I was not entirely cut off from adults and the outside world while at the mercy of people who I suspected might want to use my blood as a midnight snack.Night Camp was written for a younger audience than what I usually review, and I sometimes had a difficult time putting myself in the mindset of a younger child. If I were to encounter a vampire, I would immediately try to determine which of the many vampire mythologies in fiction most closely resembled the creatures with which I was presented. But clearly the average 13-year-old does not have the experience or analytic capability to try to understand vampires on this level. To him, a vampire is simply a blood-sucking monster, though whether such an assumption is fair is the whole point of the book.While I don't know that I would recommend Night Camp to my usual audience, it is definitely the kind of thing that might appeal to the ten-year-old in your life.",Cute Tween Tale of Terror,1327363200,0,0,4,1

I also now want a sauna of my own.I would have sworn up and down a year ago that I would never read a vampire book or any paranormal fantasy romance.  Because these kinds of books are free, I've tried them, and they're like popcorn - one is never enough.  There were some absolute dogs that I didn't finish, but thanks to the free book offerings, I've made new author friends for life.I count Vivian among them.The only problem with reading these is coming back to reality and realizing that the thud I just heard outside is NOT a vampire in the backyard or a wandering werewolf.",I'm really sorry that werewolves don't exist...,1266451200,5,5,5,1
"When I found this on audible I gave it a try. I had read positive reviews about the series and decided to listen this sequel. First of all,if you are like me, probably you will need to listen to it twice. The first time the initial ten minutes were confusing and I couldn't follow the story.  Kept listening and began to like it, especially when she is at the hospital and interacting with Lydia.  I decided on listening again and now this series is on my radar. The premise of Soul Screamers is interesting.  Kaylee gets this uncontrollable desire to scream.  Everybody thinks she gets panic attacks but it is something more. Her situation has a supernatural motivation that I find curious and I want to know more of this character.About the characters:I find Lydia a potentially great character. She is intriguing. She has an ability that could help Kaylee but I can't help but ask myself at what price to her own safety.  At the other side of the spectrum I see Kaylee's aunt.  She doesn't sound like someone Kaylee grew up with.  I don't feel to much empathy toward her.About the narration:It took me a little time to get used to Amanda Ronconi's style.  At the book's beginning she sounded detached, almost informative.  Her voice sounded in third person although she used pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" in her narration.  As the audio progressed she definitively was Kaylee.  As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I listened to this audio twice.  The second time in my listening, Ronconi sounds detached at the same parts as well.I give a 4 to the story and a 3 to the narration.

"My Soul To Lose is a good introduction to the first book in the Soul Screamers series. It's not necessary that you read it before My Soul To Take, but I do recommended it.This book tells us the story of Kaylee and her life at the mental institution where she was admitted after a certain incident at the mall with her bestfriend Emma. I easily sympathized with her and I easily loved Emma for being a very supportive friend. I am curious with one character in this book though--Lydia. She's mysterious and yet she seems to know Kaylee's secret and she's the only person in the institute who can understand her. I'm curious about what happened to her after she helped Kaylee and it would be great to know more about her in the next books. Though it's short and easy read, this book give us glimpse of Kaylee's life before she knows the truth behind her  so called ""panic attacks"". You'll be able to understand her better and it will answer some of the questions you might have when you read the first book in the series.I hope you'll take the time to read this novella. I can't say anything more about it and I don't want to give anything away that may spoil your future reading. It's good and it's enjoyable.

"I downloaded this book because  I thought it would present a balanced view of different ways to work from home - however it did not.  As others have noted, it centered mostly on to make money in a network marketing company, and did not mention other legitimate companies you can work for from home that don't require any investment except for your time.While I agree there are legitimate network marketing opportunities that are not multi-level marketing opportunities, it's been my experience that they require at least some monetary investment, not to mention time to start building a customer base before you start seeing a return on that investment.  This might be okay if you've got another source of income,  but they may not be a viable option for people who need a steady source of income or who do not have money to invest in a network marketing opportunity.Another thing that Christine Sutherland doesn't mention is the fact that many expenses that you incur as an independent contractor, including expenses  you incur working as a network marketer, can be written off on your taxes, at least in the US.  This could be because she lives in Australia, and the  laws may be different there.  She also does not give any examples of network marketing companies  that fit the criteria she mentions in her book.In summary, this book might be worth a look if you're looking for a guide about how to get started as a network marketer, however if you're looking for information on different companies that you can work for that will provide you a steady income with no monetary investment, as well as information on some of the other things you need to consider before you start working from home, there are other books you can download.",Don't download this book if you want to work from home without investing any money,1398297600,1,1,2,-1

"This is a very short Regency story about a widow and a widower in unusual circumstances.Reggie's wife and Clara's husband betrayed them -- with each other.  When they died (in kind of unclear circumstances), Reggie took Clara under his wing to help her weather the scandal.  Clara is pregnant with her late husband's child, but Reggie can't deny his feelings for her.  All of this takes place before the story even begins, so it is not surprising that the author has difficult working in the back story gracefully.  It's a novella length story that the author tries to dispose of in a couple of paragraphs.Neither of the main characters come across as true products of their time.  Other than a couple of period terms, these two are modern people plopped in a historical situation and that, aside from the unusually rushed feel of the plot, was the main thing that kept me from enjoying the story.  Reggie's attitude and decisions weren't plausible and we didn't have enough time with him to fully believe that he was willing to throw away everything that would have been important to a man of his era.  Clara didn't seem to have a core personality at all.This may be a great author (she certainly seems to have some loyal fans), but I think she needs a longer format to work her magic.",Didn't feel real at all,1369699200,2,2,2,-1

Burgundy is just a placeholder with violet eyes (And seriously - violet eyes and wine-colored hair?  Pick one dramatic feature for your heroine and leave it at that!).  My understanding is that this story is part of a longer multi-author series dealing with the book Burgundy receives as a bequest from her mother and that is fairly evident - the book was shoehorned in.This particular plot was just not a good choice for the short story format as there was not enough time to develop everything you needed to know.  The Earl needed more development if we're to believe he's the best choice for Burgundy's happiness.  How did Burgundy and Anthony fall in love in the first place?  Why did Burgundy's father try so hard to keep her away from her seemingly benevolent maternal relatives?

Within 2 days the female protagonist is packing up her bags and moving herself and her son into this perfect stranger's home.  The characters weren't really fleshed out well, they could have used a little more depth and complexity.  I think the author tried to rush the events in the story along because it was short.

"This is a bit of an odd book, the cover tells us it's based on a story by John H Carroll, although not which story that is.  The whole point of this therefore seems to be putting illustrations into the skeletonised remainder of the story.  The end product is a bit odd then.  The pictures are pretty small, some pages don't even have pictures, and in fact the first page doesn't have any at all.  The pictures that exist are interesting, colourful and well drawn but they are very small. They are laid out like someone is inserting images into a Microsoft Word document and hasn't discovered how to wrap the text around the image or anything other than centring between paragraphs or the most frequently done, centred under just a few lines of text.  I don't understand why the pictures aren't bigger, they are small on a PC, definitely not designed for small screen portable Kindle devices.The story itself ends abruptly, there's not much to it, it seems like it should be continuing on when you simply can't proceed any further.  Basically a father is telling his child what it will be like with its new cat Goober and the mischief the boy will get up to with his pet.This is worth checking out if still a free download but I wouldn't pay money for it.

"""The Door at the Top of the Stairs"" was written by Alison Holt.  This appears to be a third book for Ms. Holt and a departure from her previous two detective mystery novels. The current novel is of the psychological thriller genre. The book is written in conversational dialog spoken by the characters. The writing is straight forward and does not offer any degree of complexity in structure which should be generally acceptable by a wide audience.The story is about a young female police officer, ""Jesse Shaunessy"" twenty six years old, who was dismissed from the police force after five years of service. The police psychologist assessed Jesse to be too traumatized to continue to serve. Jesse was an undercover narcotics agent. She witnessed her partner ""Pete"" accept a bribe and sell her out to a narcotics dealer who subsequently tortured her in retaliation for shooting his brother.Jesse, looking for work, shows up at the horse farm run by 57 year old Morgan Davis and her 65 year old life partner Dr. Ryland Caldwell. Ryland is a retired psychologist who after observing the odd behavior (and physical scars) on Jesse, engages in her rehabilitation. The story of Jesse's abduction and torture is then revealed through a series of ""regressive sessions"" devised by Ryland as therapy.  While this is all going on, there is a secondary plot afoot being crafted by one Cody Maitland, a college dropout, hired by Morgan as a favor to her neighbor, Cody's father. Cody is featured as a plainly despicable young man bent on causing Jesse to get fired through his plotting of nefarious incidences that Jesse will be blamed for.At about the time that Jesse is recovered from her therapy, the story, in an unexpected twist of events, culminates in the conclusion of the drama and some additional revelations about Jesse and her ordeal.There were a number of things about this book that I did not care for. The character of Jesse and Morgan were a bit too overdone for my likes. While Jesse may have had some reason for her incorrigible behavior, Morgan's was not comprehensible in comparison. Further, I thought the male attributes applied to Morgan made her look foolish at times. The description of Richard as a ""brilliant"" narcissistic killer also seemed misplaced. There was nothing revealed about Richard that lead the reader to conclude that he was ""brilliant"".  Quite the contrary, he came across as decidedly evil, but not particularly bright as evidenced by a number of silly misjudgments.  The Character of Cody seemed equally misplaced. It was uncharacteristic for a young man like Cody to have harbored a hatred so thoroughly consuming as to result in his destruction. That's not to say it couldn't happen, just that there was no particular background given about Cody that explained his behavior and thus left the reader to his own conclusions. Finally, I did not find any appreciation of the life style portrayal of the female characters. While there is nothing inherently wrong (a non-religious view) with such a portrayal, I didn't find it necessary to advance the story. Certainly there have been many good books written with characters of alternate life styles, but these almost entirely are about the characters as persons and not about their life style per se. In this case, the depiction of all the females in the story as lesbian did not offer any necessary structure to the drama. If Morgan had been Martin, it wouldn't have mattered. Unfortunately for me, some of the intimate descriptions made me decidedly uncomfortable - as in the same realm as imagining 26 year old Anna Nicole Smith with 88 year old J. Howard Marshall II.....creepy.Overall I would recommend this novel only with reservations.

"I got this book during a free promo, because I thought it would be a funny and light read.  Yeah it was light alright.  I couldn't help thinking that it was written by an 8th grader.  It was sophomoric and juvenile. If the s word for crap was deleted, it would cut the book in half.  I have come to expect errors in indie books, but I overlook them when the story is great. Unfortunately, I think these authors never go back to reread what they have written, and correct very obvious, glaring errors. I couldn't blame the author this time for not wanting to reread any of this book. And sadly, there was no there, there.  Seinfeld always claimed it was a show about nothing.

"My goodness, what a horribly boring and ridiculous read.  The only consolation is that it only cos 99 cents.  I only got to  51 percent, and stopped because I could not tolerate it any longer.  I have read many conqueror books from 1066,and this book was like a comedy compared to this.  Not that there was  anything funny about this book, it just seemed like a poor attempt at writing a book about this topic from the author's part.  Perhaps as p as the author was trying to write a book about Norman conqueror's that was not the usual norman conqueror children as characteristics, and if that was the case, she failed miserably because norman conqueror's usually consummate the marriage ASAP after they are wed to the vanquished bride so that they have greater claim to the land.  But this norman hero seems to suffer from some ridiculous mental flaw, that he does the contrary, only because he wants her to care for  him first.  That's fine if  this this was a typical medeival romance book, but this is a norman conqueror who was given this land and bride as conquest.  This story was totally unrealistic for this era and I was really disappointed with this read.  I suggest that the author researches her history as for this particular era, then attempts to write a book about  and,make her next book about this era as nd the norman conquest more realistic.

"Stories of exorcisms are tough as they will of course all be compared to the godfather of them all The Exorcist. But how can they not? There is little a writer can do to change the angle on this one. There is also the difficulty of religion. Exorcisms in the western world are based in the Catholic faith. It takes a skilled writer to create a nuanced, complex story without falling into the for or against religious argument. Graham either lacks the skill or wanted to take sides here.William Peter Blatty's hand is all over this story. Bibles, Jesuit priests, and epileptic fits abound. Graham's story vanished numerous times to images of Linda Blair and pea soup. There is also a very religious subtext to the story. The protagonist moves from a borderline non-believer to a believer. ""She knew everything would work out. She had faith."" Throughout the story, there are repeated references to sin and guilt. I read these as implications that Cheryl (our possessed girl) was inhabited by demons because she had been corrupted by sin. A very medieval concept, particularly considering the stance the Church took toward women in the 1200s (the womb as a vessel for Satan and all that nonsense).I am still not sure if this is just a ripoff of The Exorcist or one of those religious tracts disguised as a horror story.

"I am a big fan of vampire romance novels and was given a complimentary copy of this to review.  Overall I felt the story was too short and didn't give any background information on the characters.  We are immediately thrust into the story near the culmination of the characters relationship.  Since I didn't feel that I knew the characters at all, I didn't really care what happened to them.  There should have been more information included on each characters background.  Characters also just appeared with no information on them at all.

"This time around, Josie goes to the UK to take on a ghostwriting job. I bought this book because I wanted to see if it was better than the first and I thought the author did have talent. I couldn't get into this one though I hung on to the end to see if it improved.Unfortunately, although the premise could have been good and followed on from the first novel, Bridesmaid Lotto, there was nothing in it. Firstly, as the author would have known, three months is not enough to write and deliver an ""autobiography"" in good enough shape to send to a publisher and that part should have been believable. The heroine does very little writing - two weeks to the end of the contract and she has written all of five or ten pages. She doesn't actually sit down and interview her subject, they just canter around the nightclubs and indulge in terrifying sports, thereby making the tabloids happy. The boyfriend, Jake, from the first novel makes a few phone calls to her - not very convincing since he's supposed to be keen on her.The characters were very superficial, the status of the biography subject should have indicated bodyguards, but there were none - he seemed to roam around pretty much on his own - and the heroine was totally unqualified to ghostwrite a novel for anyone. These two factors alone should have been up to scratch.All in all, my hopes for a better novel were dashed.",Superficial,1342310400,0,0,2,-1

"To me this was an extremely frustrating book to even get into.  It started with the assumption I had read the previous novel.  I hadn't.  After reading this book, I don't intend to read another one, either.  As the protagonist begins, I was totally out in left field I guess.  I had not read the previous book and there was nothing to clue me into the entire plot here.  Lalla is the protagonist who only does what she wants, which is to find out who killed an ex Marine with a heart transplant who dies literally at her feet.  If it weren't for x-ray being enabled, there is no way I could have kept track of all of the characters that were thrown around this book.  They were not built up to give them any identity of their own and they just showed up whenever someone else was supposed to be there with another clue, I guess.  Typos were too abundant for me.  The story just lacked any finesse and was a great disappointment to me.  If I had read the first book, it might have made more sense here.  That first book was referred to so many times I almost put down this one.  It was not a stand alone book and should have just been part of a series.  That MIGHT have helped here.

"After reading The Survival of Marvin Baines I read the comments others had posted on Amazon. I was surprised by the overly positive reviews. The story line has potential and in the hands of writers like John Irving or Anne Tyler it could have lived up to the promotional. I found it trite, far from humorous and vaguely entertaining. Marvin, with his company of two dimensional characters, exchange banter which some might find funny. I found the attempt shallow. Only in the fourth section of the book when the path of a former heart throb, Janice Cromer, crosses with Marvin's does the story gain momentum.

The heroine seems completely willing to fall for two guys (she's in love within 2 days of meeting them) without any hesitation.  When they start telling her they ""won't take no for an answer,"" I kept thinking she'd panic because they were controlling.  But she just went along.  She went for strong and interesting in the first ten pages to bland and compliant for the rest of the book.The heroes were fine.  They didn't make me sigh or get excited.  They were...fine.Finally, the formating on the book drove me insane.  Long, long paragraphs that tells me the author doesn't know when to break for a thought.

Then, stating one always ends up where they belong.  Well, not really then - not if one character has to be rid of for the other to be with another.  It felt like the author had the attachment to Devlin, not Elizabeth.  Which allowed more sense to tale overall than the thoughts within.Devlin's monologues were confusing at best in trying to convey the process to Elizabeth.  He never succeeded fully and her decision was not made in full knowledge - even though it brought resolution for her.  Though the resolution was a dissatisfacory conclusion overall.  For, it is unclear he fulfilled his wish.  And, rebirth would not disencumber the soul mate factor (of reincarnation) - rather it merely sets up a new generation of life of searching for missing piece.  Many believing in reincarnatiin will be dissatisfied with the solution given here as sever as the souls are what is connected and reincarnated - not the bodies.  I realize Devlin is a ghost and is found in a dream - however, that connect is as strong as merely feeling a presence (unseen) around a person.I cannot say whether Elizabeth's story outside this short finds resolution or not as I have not read the full the author alludes to.

"I'm slowly learning that when there are less than ten reviews of a book to take them with a grain of salt.  After all, everyone has at least ten friends that could write a review.  This book is nothing more than a long, drawn out war story in which the American's seldom lose.  However, the author completely ignores some very important facts.It starts with a massive EMP attack on the US but somehow, communications and even travel are restored relatively quickly and the US soon learns that North Korea is the instigator of the attack.  So, how do we retaliate?  By re-commissioning warships that are decades old and sending them into battle against North Korea.  But wait a minute, at least half the US fleet was at sea, presumably out of the range of the EMP but somehow, we can't use our carriers and their air wings to fight the enemy, we have to do it the old fashioned way with battleships and destroyers and car carriers as landing craft.  And even if the entire naval surface fleet was damaged, the subs would all still be operational.In reality we would have surfaced a couple of subs off the coast, peppered it with cruise missiles and if that didn't discourage the North Koreans, used some nuclear armed missiles from the same sub and obliterated the leadership of the enemy.  And even if we didn't want to go nuclear (remember, they used 80 nuclear weapons against the US), an aircraft carrier parked off the coast would have destroyed their weak airforce and carpet bombed the heck out of them and the whole thing would have been over in days.Why we would spend all the money and time bringing old ships back on line has more to do with the author's love of old naval hardware than a proper premise for this book.  While the writing style is decent, the story line is so implausible that even suspending disbelief makes it hard to like this book.  Does anyone really think we would have a kill ratio of 100:1 in our favor when operating on foreign soil with limited supplies and munitions?  And yet the well armed and equipped North Koreans, who have planned the attack for months, are falling like flies in the face of a retreating US force in South Korea.To those that loved the book, glad you did.  To those that haven't bought it yet even the free sample isn't helpful because it covers the actual attack nuclear attack against the US which is pretty interesting and well written.  However, thirty pages after the end of the sample, it all fell apart for me and I absolutely struggled to finish this book, more because I hate wasting money that because there was anything left worth reading.",The premise of this book is completely wrong,1319068800,29,29,1,-1

"I really wanted to like this book, as I am a sucker for books set in Southern California, especially places where I either lived or visited many times. Palm Springs is in the latter category. While the opening chapter had promise, with its details of the real estate industry that ring true to me, the rest of the book was very disappointing.First of all, if the book was written in 2004, and there is no indication that it is a period piece set in the 1960s-1980s, then why name the protagonist Henry (outside of the royal family, I don't know many Henrys, especially one born in 1942: book set in 2004, Henry is 62, etc). And his wife's name was Irma? Why not Cynthia, or Nancy, or Linda -- names that were popular during the 1940s and don't have a whiff of the 1920s or 30s about them. They were married in the late 1960s -- not right after VJ Day! This may seem minor, but I have little interest in reading about a Henry, or an Irma, even though she dies before the story opens. It ages them for me --- gives, at least to me, an impression of a really, really old married couple.Next, there is far too much detail about the little things in Henry's life -- the razor Henry uses, what kind of sandwich old Irma ate before she died in their Las Vegas hotel room, the list goes on and on. As another reviewer noted, this seems like padding to bring up the word count. And the author jumped around with the back story on Henry and Irma -- I thought we were through with the back story, and there it comes again, right in the middle of Henry walking around the house where the murder took place.I am glad to read that the author is going to revise this book. I hope that he tightens the action, and doesn't give us every little detail of Henry's morning rituals, etc. as though he were Marcel Proust. As to the names --- well, we are probably stuck with them....I will keep checking for the revised version, as I still am hooked on the setting, and I admire anyone who takes the time to write and publish, knowing that he or she is opening themselves up to criticism.",Room for Improvement on this First Effort,1308873600,1,1,2,-1

"I'm sorry to say that my view of this book is aligned with many of the other 1 to 3 star reviewers--the stories (being really short, some of them only 1 paragraph) get a bit boring after a while, because they don't have much depth.Maybe they shouldn't have much depth, since the whole book was thrown together in a week as a collection of really short viewpoints and stories from anyone who wanted to participate. As another reviewer pointed out, many of the viewpoints were from people located far from the disaster, musing or wondering about their own introspections and feelings about the event.It seems to me the book would have been stronger if at least the shortest and most irrelevant viewpoints had been tossed out, and if some of the repetitive stories of buildings swaying had been removed unless they offered a unique perspective.So as an interesting book for the general reader, I think this book falls well short of the mark, unless you are specifically looking for the distant viewpoints of mostly writers and journalists and English speaking people who were on the fringes (or further) of the disaster.But nonetheless, maybe the book did achieve its stated goal--to raise some money for relief efforts.","Well intentioned, but not very good reading",1365206400,4,4,2,-1

I did not like the heroine, I can understand her quest for revenge, but her children should have come first and the hell she puts them through letting them think their dad is alive is unconscionable.  That she allows them to think another agent is their father and allow them to get attached to him was over the top.  UNACCEPTABLE.  As a single parent they depended on her and her ""job"" being in the way of her showing up on time and fulfilling the obligations she takes on at their school and that all falls to the wayside for her job.  Why didn't she hire a housekeeper?  She's strong in one aspect and a complete failure and wimp in others to an extreme that isn't reasonable.Sometimes I can ignore inconsistencies and put outlandish situations aside and just go along with the ride, but not here.

"I downloaded this story because the concept interested me. Unfortunately, the execution misses on two major points. First, the writing fluctuated between being overwritten, rife with excessive and overlapping details that were irrelevant to advancing the story, or underwritten to the point of confusion. I had to re-read entirely too many sentences just to figure out what the author was saying. It seemed like the author fell in love with some sentences from the first draft and then during the revision, he never stopped to question whether those sentences flowed with the new paragraph. Despite alot of physical description of furniture placement and where people were located within a room, very few scenes standout in my memory. Two, the ending is illogical. It was the most overwritten scene in the book. This is not a spoiler beyond disclosure of the weather from the final scene. It was raining three sentences ago; I don't need to be reminded that it's still raining unless the rain has changed in some critical way. More importantly, the character's actions didn't make sense based on the development of the story. I think the author was trying to describe a culturally conflicted young man, but the conflict he envisioned in his head didn't make it into the final product. Within the realm of possible explanations for his behavior, none of them were supported by the character I've just read about.I think the fundamental basis for the story is interesting, but the work itself needs a major revision.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman",I Don't Get It.,1345939200,1,1,2,-1

"Would You Remember Me? This is the question asked by the title.  Of course not is the answer, because you've got nothing interesting to say, didn't do anything interesting in your life so far, didn't have interesting good or bad that happened to you to justify even contemplating suicide.  All this girl talks about is how depressed she is and tells each family member, well lectures each family member on life.  Mum you used to be fun, until life started to get a little tough and you gave up.  Dad you know you left me, when you no longer wanted to live with mum and asked me who I wanted to live with.  Sister you took a lot of attention away from me when you were born and have always been an attention seeker ever since, but I still love you. This is the whole ten minute read.  Nothing exciting happens or happened to her at all.The writer (fictional character one) just needed someone to talk to who would tell her life's not all about you honey, and educate her a bit with some sort of reality check.  A new younger sister is going to take some attention away from you.  Your dad and mum won't always love each other, the real world isn't a cartoon, love rarely lasts forever.Obviously we don't know if the girl actually kills herself or not since notes are obviously written before the act. Since this was so unmoving, unemotional it needed something after.  Either a letter or the eulogy written by the people she talks about in her letter.  Or a follow up letter by the girl herself if she didn't do it saying how she realised how stupid that letter was and how she's glad she didn't actually kill herself.There's also no details at the end for anyone feeling like this themselves that are the standard for any piece of fiction dealing with suicide such as if you are feeling depressed or need someone to talk to ring Kids Help Line on 1800 55 1800.Suicide notes are a difficult thing to do in fiction, however they can actually be well done, and entertaining, such as withTo Whom It May Concernby Piper Downs.","What is the Point of This?

"This is a pleasant little diversion, with characters who could become interesting one day. It does, alas, have a certain, by-the-numbers style, with a breezy, simplistic writing style (both prose and plotting) that is laconic and lacks force. Tension does not build. Big events have about the same impact as little ones.  Sometimes it feels more like you're reading a screenplay than a book, or an outline of a book. Yawn, at times. The technical aspects of writing are fine. The parts that make it a craft are missing. This may have some potential, though, and it is fun at times.

"This book had a good premise - a retired KGB agent sent from modern Russia to kill a member of the International Monetary Fund.  Unfortunately, the premise was the only good thing about this book, as the characters and situations were simply implausable.  Just before an important vote, a US IMF member is killed by faulty brakes on his brand new Lexus and despite the police being surprised, the incident is treated strictly as an accident! Even the new widow is unbelievably stoic about her husband's death and is more interested in planning the funeral than grieving or questioning. Coincidently, his brother happens to be a retired CIA operative and he alone is suspicious.  Even when a second member of the IMF narrowly escapes a terrorist-style bomb and the brother tries to impress the importance, do the US authorities seem somewhat interested.  Where's Homeland Security, the FBI, even the CIA?Without giving away the whole plot (although it wouldn't be a loss) the story moves to Russia, where the brother, his gutsy girlfriend and the original KGB agent team up to right all wrongs.  The few interesting looks into today's Russia are dwarfed by the repetitive, angst-ridden political intrigue.  If we heard a certain politician was ambitious and ruthless once, we heard it several times.  The chase scenes were yawn-worthy and I found myself paging through to find something of interest.

It was like trying to swallow peanut butter without a liquid chaser; so so very hard to do. I don't think I've ever given a book a single star rating but I had a lot of issues with it and hardly any pluses.The main chick (I don't remember her name), was forgettable. She was whiny, and so very annoying. I couldn't stand her. Maybe that was the author's intent but I for one have to like the main characters some in order to give the book a shot. She was a healthy woman with body issues and continually whined about having to mate with the twins, Deep and Locke. She didn't like them at all in the beginning when Locke, the nicer of the twins was nothing but kind to her. Deep was crass and very blunt in the way he spoke to her which she had issue with.I don't mind the menage going on but it was so far out there I couldn't accept any of it. I've read both books in the Soul-Linked Saga where there is one woman with multiple partners at once and that author told the story beautifully. Even though it was all fiction, it was believable and well written. This story was a bunch of this and that with some sexual encounters tossed in.

I do understand it better once he said that he had her checked on every few days to keep tabs on her and when the pictures of her and her therapist (he only say her hugging on a strange man repeatedly) came back to him, I think he thought she moved on and figured he should to.

"The prequel to the Tall, Dark, and Deadly romance series based in Manhattan.My TakeYawn. Oops, sorry...didn't mean to yawn in your face. It was just so hard to stay awake through this. It started out well and quickly degenerated into manufactured tension and stupid drama.What? Reeves has to take over the law firm because...why? None of the reasons she poses are any different from why she shouldn't take it over? He abandoned her dad. An-n-d, what did she do? What obligation does the law firm have to the client anyway? He hired her dad. Her dad is out of the picture. So... Can anyone explain this to me? Why not just let the firm go? It would screw up the reasons for the story, of course. Which is a good reason to give me a better excuse!At least, Lindsey has her self-worth. That anyone else might prize something other than money or her idiot dad is beside the point.I can understand her wanting to stop practicing criminal law. If what she believes to be truth really is. And I can see where working counterterrorism can be more satisfying as it's actively going after the bad guys instead of helping the bad guys go free. Duh.Please tell me that a ""venti Carmel latte"" is a coffee drink named for the city in California. I know Jones can spell ""caramel"" as it shows up just paragraphs later. Lindsey and Mark take an extra day in Vegas to play, relax, meet an ""alien female with big hears"".Well, I suppose making Lindsey an idiot who allows her issues to control her life and enable her to make stupid decisions is one way of creating drama. So, Lindsey runs off to Vegas, away from Mark, and then she cries because he doesn't chase after her. How old is she?? Twelve??Oooh, Lindsey finally figures it out. She already knows what a jerk her dad is. That Mark had a blow-up with her dad and left the law firm. That he might have had good reason for it. Especially the ones he's been telling her since the confrontation at his apartment door. Oh, no, we have to get halfway through the story before Lindsey realizes that gee, maybe Mark wasn't the bad guy. L.A.M.E.About the best part of this story is Mark's retort to goading by John Conner about how police errors set a lot of bad guys free. That he hates what defense lawyers ""have to do for the system...as much as anyone else, but I respect what the principles are built on.""Jones, please find an editor or some friends who won't be afraid to tell you the truth. You have a nice idea that got lost.The StoryDamn, damn, damn, she has got to talk Reeves into taking it over. She can't do it. She doesn't want it. Not after the fiasco of the Hudson case a few years ago. He's got to return and take this case over. Take the law firm over. Who cares why he left. As long as she doesn't have to do it.This new case, the Williams one, it's just like Hudson all over again. Dead girls who look. Just. Like. Lindsey. And her father is sure that Williams is innocent. Just. Like. Hudson.And Lindsey can't do it. Reeves has got to come back. But he has his price and Lindsey isn't sure it's safe to pay it.The CharactersLindsey Paxton (and her twin Lindsay) is a twit. Oops again, er, I mean, she's an FBI agent now after having run away from her father's law firm. Everything needs to be her way to her happiness and screw with anyone else's issues, 'cause she's the only one allowed to have them. Oops, bitchy much? Edward Paxton is her father, and he desperately wants Lindsey to come back to the law firm. The one he's screwed up. Especially now that he has cancer. Maggie Moore is her father's long-term assistant, and she's happy Lindsey is back.Mark Reeves is her father's ex-law partner. He's now consulting in Manhattan and wants nothing to do with Edward's law firm. Todd Walker is one of her father's current partners.Steve is her former NYC partner at the FBI. He's teamed up with Garth Bryant these days. Greg Harrison is her ex-boyfriend and the district attorney. Lindsey just loves to meet up with him so she can make more really stupid decisions.Professor Roger Williams is the new Hudson. A professor at NYU who claims he's innocent. Detectives Kevin Woods and John Conner are Vegas PD and very cautious as to why Lindsey and Mark are in Las Vegas inquiring about their murder victims.Friends of the latest victim, Elizabeth Moore, include Vicky Kencade who provides a crucial clue; Tom Maloney and Todd Rogers both seem to be Elizabeth's recently ex-boyfriend; Rick, a.k.a., Cowboy, is Todd's roommate (hmmm, Lindsey never does manage to visit Tom Maloney); and, Victor Ruzo owns the Pink Panther bar that some victims patronized.The CoverThe cover is a couple holding each other: her arms loosely around his neck, his hands on her hips. She's a long-haired blonde looking out at us while he's a long-haired brunet who only looks corporate due to his button-down striped shirt.I'm guessing that the title refers to the Secrets Exposed when Lindsey finally learns the truth about Mark's contretemps with her father and Greg's complicity in the cover-up. It could also refer to what we learn about Jones and her editors...","Oh, yeah, it was deadly all right...yawn...",1357689600,2,2,2,-1

"I loved the first book, ""Voidhawk,"" and eagerly looked forward to reading this sequel. My first reaction was ""What happened to Dexter?"" He went from an interesting character to a mean-spirited, abusive person, lashing out at  anyone who came near. Other characters seemed to simply be targets for the captain. The storyline for Rosh was a mess. And the blood and killing -- goof grief, although i loved battle-oriented stories, this was literally over-kill. Many places I felt the plot line jumped without warning, and some-how I missed how they went 10,000 years into the future. The finnish felt rushed and incomplete.

"This story is not badly written and I think the author has the capability to write a decent novel. That would however require a lot more work on the characters and the plot.A few examples regarding the characters: The main charachter, Kim, is ""notorious for spending it as I made it"" - yet she has so much stashed away that she can spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer and on DNA analyses?? It doesn't add up. A helicopter pilot that drinks champagne (and just not any bubbly but Dom Perignon!) when he is on call with a pager on his hip?  Kim is 28 and her mother wants her to get married and have children, but there is ""disappointment on  Mom's face"" when she learns that the guy Kim is dating isn't a doctor, but a pilot? These characters don't ring true!About the plot: The story starts with Kim finding a human finger in a tin of dog food. Kim, a nurse, decides she has to find out whose finger it is and how it got there so she sets off to Florida where the dog food is manufactured. This is rather weird, but that goes for a lot of stories in this genre, so why not? But then the story loses all credibility: There, on her first night, she just happens to go to a club where she finds out about a person that's missing, and then she just happens to catch the licence plate numbers of some people of interest, she just happens to find the magazines where letters for an anonomous letter were cut out, she just happens to find an old journal and so on, and so on. All these coincidences that kept ocurring made it all so unrealistic that I completely lost interest in the story. Not to mention all the crazy things she does, a dog autopsy, trespassing, stealing the above mentioned journal etc.I believe that in the days of paper novels this book, had it been sent to a publisher, never would have been printed, but that the publisher would have seen  potential in this author and recommended another try with more effort put into making the characters consistent and the plot more credible.",The writing is OK but the characters and the plot are not,1340755200,0,0,2,-1

"Setting aside the zaniness that marks so much of his other work, Carroll has created a much more subdued and low key story here.  However, the lack of resolution and focus hurts it overall.While the story begins with the POV of a young woman watching a cheesy training video during her first day at a fast food job, this character is quickly and mysteriously abandoned so the story can focus on her boss.  He's a introverted man who experiences love at first sight with a, well, blue haired alien.  The story kinda meanders around with Carroll telling us how much the two love each other and then it just kinda ends.  Along the way, we're told that multiple characters think that the young man is gay.  I think Carroll might have been trying to make a point about how people who are different are judged, but it was confusing because their reasoning for thinking he was gay just didn't make sense, even by the standards of unfair judgments.There might have been some potential in this story, but it seemed as if the author didn't really want to do the work to develop it.",An incomplete thought,1401148800,0,0,2,-1

"J. A. Konrath's humorous horror novelette ""Shapeshifters Anonymous"" resembles an out-of-shape runner running a distance race. It gets off to a good start but sets too fast a pace, then runs out of gas in the home stretch and barely makes it to the finish line.The premise is terrific. The protagonist, Robert Weston Smith, suffers from bizarre blackouts two or three nights a month, then discovers that he's been eating some pretty bizarre things during these blackouts. When his doctor can't find a rational explanation, he fears he may be turning into a werewolf and turns to a highly unusual self-help group, Shapeshifters Anonymous, where he meets with others like him.Tongue is all the way in cheek in this one, and Konrath's dry humor works rather well in the beginning, which bears at least a passing resemblance to reality. Once Smith settles in at the meeting however, the story winds up spinning out of control very rapidly. Soon, he learns that he and his fellow shapeshifters are in deadly peril from Salvation Army Santa Clauses, who are demented followers of the real Santa Claus, who has been hunting shapeshifters for centuries. The climax is a huge battle between the forces of ho-ho-ho and those of the Animal Kingdom.Any comic will tell you that timing is important in comedy. You have to give the audience just enough time to appreciate one joke before moving to the next. Konrath loses track of that principle, however. Rather than mine the comic possibilities of a group of people who turn into animals, he rushes into the big fight scene where he stacks one bizarre visual gag on top of another. Of course, these aren't visual gags in the cinematic sense... readers can't see the bizarre battle on screen where some effective FX work or comic acting might make it funny. Instead, they are descriptions of a deranged Salvation Army Santa doing battle with a turtle with vaguely human features. At some point in the narrative (and in my case it happened rather quickly), those descriptions lost any amusement factor whatsoever.I realize that humor is very subjective and some people may find this entire concept hilarious. Unfortunately, I didn't. The snappy jokes of the first third of the book turned into, for me, the equivalent of a bad professional wrestling Battle Royale, and the story became a bit of a chore to finish, even at fifty pages. I admire Konrath's imagination and the highly unusual storyline he concocted here. I'm just disappointed that he couldn't maintain that premise for the entire length of the novelette.",Out of Shape Story Runs Out of Gas at the End,1393891200,0,0,2,-1
"Other reviewers have commented on the similarities between this and the Harry Potter opus.  Not unjust.  But it shares some of the flaws of the Potter books too. Too many people are determined to hide crucial information from anyone who might make use of it.  I grew tired of reading variations on ""you're not ready for that knowledge yet"", and ""...decided not to share that information just yet.""  The middle third of the book simply wouldn't have happened if the protagonist had followed instructions. There weren't any good reasons for suddenly concealing one of the most important events in the book; just a whim.  Also like Potter the book contains long expository sequences that don't seem to develop the character or plot.  Lots of riding hither and thither and descriptions of the world.  Some readers may prefer that style - it does expose the full scope of world building.  I like world building, but I prefer a tighter novel with an emphasis on plot emerging from character.I think that much of the flaws result from the fact that this is a first book.  Two of the characters (Varden and Timlin) are described inconsistently. I think this is to give the author room to explore their complexity in future novels, but the effect in this novel is to make them incomprehensible plot devices. The protagonist, like Potter, reminds me of the Japanese ""silent but good"" protagnist, but I think is much more effectively characterized than Potter.  It is difficult to portray the fact that adolescents can be weak willed and subject to peer pressure without reminding us that we used to be that way.  I think the author has done this exceptionally well. (at times it is uncomfortable to read; I want to slap the protagonist upside the head, but I recognize the difficulty of standing up against a strong willed but blockheaded friend).I liked the world (I just wish it were described tersely) and the suspense as I tried to identify the true antagonists. (wish we'd been a bit more fair there).If you're looking for a quick, easy read to entertain, this is probably at an appropriate price point.

"Youngest brother Danny Jamison has a lot to learn about women, and even more to learn about himself...When God was handing out out pride, Danny Jamison must have gotten in line twice, because he's about to let the best thing that's ever happened to him slip away--Emily Harris.Emily Harris is head-over-heels in love with Danny, but she's not sure she can take his jealous mood swings anymore. Something has to give or his Foolish Pride is going to be the end of them.--Review--Unfortunately something did give and it was Emily. I'll give her some credit for breaking up with Danny in the first place but that's it. She was way too emotional where Danny was concerned and couldn't resist him, after their initial breakup she spent the next two or three days crying and crying and crying and eating. While Danny thought and knew that he was a giant jerk to her he still didn't change. Instead, Emily was the one who went back to him really trying to make things work because she loved him after he essentially gave up after the first try.Then there was the whole 'best friend' and ex-boyfriend bit which made me want to slap Emily for not kicking them out of her apartment earlier and tellling them to f-off or at least mind their own business.",Not a good relationship,1375660800,0,0,2,-1
"I don't even know. I read it in about ten minutes. It is so weird. I thought it was going to be a horror book and I was so excited.

She has to go and save her sister Angie. What is supposed to be blood and gore is really just grape jelly. They bleed jelly. And the Little Girl eats it. Then I am pretty sure she eats her sister's finger because she found it severed. I don't know. Definitely not what I expected.

"This is a very short novella. It takes place between the first and second book in the Twilight of Avalon series.  It is the story of Dera, an army whore who finds herself being offered shelter by Queen Isolde at Dinas Emrys if she would agree to help out with caring for the wounded. Dera has a 2-year-old son to care for and having a dry place to sleep and food to eat is the best she could hope for, and she readily agrees to the arrangement. When a wounded man bursts into the workroom spouting off about traitors against King Madoc, Dera volunteers to go and warn the king on the battlefield that he must return to Dinas Emrys before it is overrun by the traitor Marche.Not knowing any of the backstory, this tale would have been more enjoyable if I knew the story between Isolde and Dera more intimately. That being said, there wasn't much character development and I found the choppy sentences distracting.

"As a general rule, I figure that a novel needs to have characters that the reader cares about. Even if you hate the character, that's enough, and this novel has characters that are pleasant enough to suit anyone.And as a general rule, the setting needs to be interesting. Livi is in a small town flower shop during the VietNam era, which is certainly adequate. A brother has died in the war, a farmer has died in his field, loading a round bale on a Sunday.The author needs to have a full toolbox of vocabulary and grammar, so that the words have humor, grace and color, and this author certainly has that.In fact, this novel has everything it needs except an arc. This is a slice of life like a piece of cake: it just lays there. A novel needs to be a video clip, not a snapshot. In a stand-alone novel, the arc is about how things happen to change the protagonist. In a series, the arc is about how thing happen to change the characters surrounding the protagonist. InDelivery, however, nothing ever seems to happen.Because it has all those other elements, though, this might be a great book to read if you can't sleep. It certainly isn't going to keep you awake, wondering what's going to happen next. By the time you get a third of the way through the book, you're pretty sure that what will happen next is just more of the same.Obviously, a lot of hard work went into this book, by a promising and talented author. Given a plot, her next book could be a great piece of literature.","Starts Slow, Then Fizzles Out",1313884800,4,4,2,-1

I read it in one night.  Little longer than a short story.  ""The Last Fall"" is about a man on Earth that has decided to commit suicide when he is interupted by Joshua and given a new purpose in life in another world.  Xeno, which is his new name in his new world, has been given the job to find out where and how the last stand of humans occured before they were wiped out by Nua'Lath.  He and his sidekick, Bailey, travel for 12 years to find out what happened.  (They never age.)  The story is narrated by Xeno and told to his son.Science Fiction really isn't my favorite genre.  Usually avoid it all together.  This one is futuristic and has man eating zombie like things.  However, as far as science fiction goes, this is a  pretty good book.  Well written and interesting.

"I am glad this was a short read. The intrigue in the story was good enough for me to keep reading, but there were definitely some problems. There were too many spelling errors to count. The writer jumped from writing in past tense to writing in present tense. The dialogue was rather childish.There were errors in some of the content. A man would not spend time and money to build a house then not bother at all to furnish it properly. He would not have thrown a grenade at the door and given the attackers better access to the inside. The story jumps from them investigating to the house being attacked to the FBI taking over the investigation. The FBI would not decide that the characters are to play dead after Josh shoots up the getaway vehicle. A person as adept with firearms as Dana would not have to be told to put a bullet into the chamber of the gun. A man who is trained to fight will not volunteer his qualifications just to scare someone off.As for the romance aspect of it, the writer does absolutely nothing to build up the romance.

I don't know, upon reflection, if he was trying to write a serious fantasy novel or a send-up of one, but either way, it doesn't work.I normally make notes of major characters on a pad while I'm reading, because sometimes it's necessary for keeping track of who is who. Absolutely necessary for Crystal Warrior. By page 15 the reader is introduced to Althea, Larissya (with the requisite flashing green eyes), Sorel, Grinelm, Robeson, Brunel, Talos, Thoren, Barbl, Leef, Jinga, Adan, Ulon, Roate--all difficult names (C.J. Cherryh learned not to do this)--14 characters in all. There were more to come as the story progressed.Then there are the following: cryayl, guaye, silak, kalok, klidats, gannek, atak, palnk, polgna, pinrose, wyven, widgen, zinna birds, solecjuts, gragnok--all animals or plants or objects of some sort. Easy to remember, no? No. I won't even try to list all the bizarre place names.One amusing note: the author uses the word ""plonk"" as a substitute for a well known swear word ending in ""k"".I must say, all of the strange words and names did distract me from misspelled and misused words and punctuation errors, as I tried to make sense of the storyline and keep everything straight in my head.I get the feeling that Mr. Cooley loves fantasy and tried to pour all his love and all his ideas all at once into a book. I respect him for that; I love fantasy, too. But I ask him to reflect and reconsider his approach and his barrage of exotic names for things and people.If you are going to read this book, be prepared to take notes, or just blow it off and skim through for the overall story (which gets seriously weird by the end).",Either a Send-Up or a Really Bad Novel,1348617600,4,4,2,-1
"I found this short romance unbelievable and dull.I'm not sure how the two main characters fell in love.  They only knew each other four days and they hardly spent any time together.  Attraction I can understand.  Love just didn't make any sense.Unbelievable can be overcome in a romance, but this was just very dull too.  The characters were just so good - unrealistically, relentlessly, unceasingly good - and nothing much of interest happens to them.Maybe if this had been a full length novel the author could have made the love story more convincing, the characters more than one-dimensional, and inserted some action or real conflict.  There was conflict, but the resolutions were telegraphed so explicitly to the reader that you never feel the impact of it.",Unbelievable and dull,1317859200,4,4,1,-1
"I prefer mysteries that keep me guessing up to the explanation at the end, and I figured this one out by the end of the second chapter.  By that time I also didn't particularly care for the main character, though I liked her older son. I found the constant references to the missing husband rather irritating, especially since the author doesn't tell us who Alexi was until his mystery-shrouded name had been sprinkled through the text five times.  One reviewer liked the lack of explanations in the book, but I don't enjoy passages that make me feel like the author is trying to play games with my head.  If the character doesn't know something, I'm OK with not knowing it, but pages of gloomy ""Alexi is missing"" with no explanation of who he was to warrant this attention made me grouchy.  I skipped to the end to confirm my guess and didn't feel any need to fill in the missing chapters.

"The beautiful, but pale Laura Brenton is separated from her handsome and very wealthy husband. Michael writes romance novels, and Laura has lived lavishly on the money while having an affair with a 25-year old man (a little younger or ""decades younger"" than she is, depending on who is telling the story). Laura meets with Michael to collect his signed copies of their divorce papers, while plotting to have the entire estate all to herself. Michael, however, comes to the meeting with a rose, some champagne and the desire that they reconcile - though he remembers to bring along a little ""insurance"" just in case that doesn't happen. When any chance at reconciliation fails, both Laura and Michael are determined to come out of the relationship as the winner-takes-all.What I liked about this book:1)It had a nice cover;2)It was short - it took about an hour to read, and I was happy not to have wasted any more of my time;3)I learned how to work many of the features on my new Kindle as I made notes and highlights of all the typos, grammatical errors and editing mistakes - an impressive number given that the book was so short.What I didn't like:1)Sentences flowed poorly. ""Laura took a few steps back and stopped in front of the looking glass. Laura turned around and she moved closer to the mirror while gazing at her reflection in the looking glass."" As she examines herself, she notices a few lines around her eyes, which upsets her greatly. She then looks ""at her pale nearly flawless yet pretty complexion with a smile."" She ""tosses back her hair"" - not once but three times in two pages.2)Commas are missing, typos abound (""No. Not not yet,"" Michael says at one point. Later, Laura says ""It will all be mine off course."")3)Word usage is downright strange in places. For example: ""She closed her eyes and shook her head before taking a deep breath and opening her orbs"" and ""the young woman collapsed to the floor atop her spine.""4)Bad writing, no editing. She tells Michael ""And I'm not your wife,"" but nine sentences later, she says ""I am your real wife..."" Michael is called ""the handsome man"" again and again through the book - we get it, ok? Michael ""focused his sight on the large black door that lay embedded in the wall a few yards away from him."" (aren't doors generally embedded in walls?) Michael always ""snatches"" the pen, usually while ""gazing"" at the rose. The writing style, overall, was immature and sloppy. Someone fell ""with an audible crash."" A ""tiny vial"" shatters into ""thousands of tiny fragments"" (must have been very tiny...)5)Even if grammar and bad writing don't bother you, the lack of character development and any pretense of depth to the story should be enough to deter you from purchasing this book. The author gives us no reason at all to identify with either Laura or Michael, and the suspense is so poorly developed that it evokes nothing in the reader. Without writing a spoiler, I'll just say that the ending is totally unrealistic and unnecessarily gruesome.Don't waste your time with this one.I was given a copy of this book by LibraryThing in exchange for writing a fair and honest review.",Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This One,1334016000,1,1,1,-1

I won't be reading the next book in the series, that's for sure.  I ended up having to take a break from this book to read another book.  I pretty much had to force myself to return and finish it.  The story was kind of disjointed and not very fluid.  I really wanted to like the main character Rae...but this just felt like this another ""vamp vs were"" love story with a weak, unknowing woman.  But instead it was a vampire vs. a fairy.  It was a half hearted love story at best.  Breandan (whom she is mated to) and Tomas (whom she equally cares for) both get the short end of the stick.  Neither really wins the girl.  I didn't feel like Rae was really into either guy, it seemed kind of forced and lacking.  Actually, the whole story seemed forced. Rae learning that she is a fairy, finding out about the two tribes of fairies, the rules of fairy life and fairy politics...blah, blah, blah. Good rebel fairies versus evil Devlin and his followers.  To top it off, the whole all demons vs humans angle didn't really grab me.

I cant actually see what it had to do with the storyline.I didnt like this book. Its icky to think that a father would basically bully and coerce a mature woman to date his 17 year old son to teach him a lesson. And giving a child or teen the illusion of freedom almost always backfires. The basic storyline was pretty predictable although I was continually surprised that a 30-something, in-control woman would allow a teen to date her within her own sphere. Even hanging out in his world seemed a stretch. I guess that this was the author's idea of a meet-cute but it left a bad taste in my mouth. And who was taking the calculated risk on romance?

I prefer the stories like this and ""The Six Swans"", in which the day is won through persistence and cleverness. Also, he cheats the devil, which is always a nice touch. Many of these stories are solved through nothing more interesting than dumb luck.This version of ""The Frog Prince"" has a very beautiful beginning, but the rest of the story is disjointed, uninspired, and annoying.Overall it was very uneven, and next time I'll search Project Gutenberg for the full tales.",Poor Selection.,1286755200,67,67,2,-1

"I wanted this book to work out, but it kept getting wordier and wordier with the mental illness issue and the drug abuse issue. There was not one character who had any redeeming characteristics. Everyone in the story had issues from their lives that caught up to them at the time of the story. The author hit on child abuse, drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, mental illness, abuse of women times two, the issue of a gay teenager coming out of the closet, police stupidity, a protagonist who was an idiot, and an antagonist so far out in left field that he was the least believable character.  Then there was the endless talking with nothing to say. Each character pointed their finger at some other cause for their dilemma without one ounce of responsibility, a murder mystery with no mystery as to the killer. The ending was stupid.

"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time.","Interesting Premise, But Very Poorly Written",1320451200,6,6,2,-1

And someone is threatening her life.This is the sequel to ""Broken Wings"" and, if I didn't know any better, I'd wonder if the main character was a different person. Yes, there's this blurb in the beginning saying she's been forced to forget her soul connection by the powers that be, but now she's clueless and helpless. Unfortunately, all of her coworkers at the FBI seem to be inept as well. I mean, Rio can go deep undercover to trap a mobster on a case that took years to develop, yet she and her colleagues can't handle one little stalker? And they break procedure numerous times regarding the threatening letters. Any civilian friend or relative who interrupted or threatened an undercover operation would be in big trouble, possibly arrested for interfering with police procedure, and the agent involved would be censured and maybe even fired.

She is attracted to Vic, though shies away from any man who's job puts him at risk. She's tough on the front but is struggling with the death of her husband. Her kids are her life, now, and her oldest is protective of her.But then we get to Vic. There's something about him that just rubbed me the wrong way. He almost seems too immature. Maybe I was basing my opinion of the protective alpha male on Lori Foster's Edge of Honor men (I read this shortly after I finished the first three of those books) but they just seemed so cool and collected. Vic came across like a dramatic teenager. If I read the words ""kill me now"" one more time, I was going to burn the book. Gina wants to talk about their relationship. Kill me now. Her son glares at him because he's protective of his mother. Kill me now. He needs to have a discussion with Gina's son. Kill me now. Gina wants to tell her how she feels. Kill. Me. Now. Ugh!The story line had promise. The idea that Vic's job somehow compromises the security of the ones he loves has the makings for a good plot. I just felt like the personality of the characters took away from the story. I'm sure it's just a matter of preference, but I think that Vic's personality would have been better suited for a romantic comedy as opposed to romantic suspense. And I probably would have liked him better in that setting. In this book, he just annoyed me.",Hero was annoying,1314835200,2,2,2,-1
"This is comically bad. With the very suspicious number of high reviews of a book with a plot so ludicrous, with characters so unbelievable, and so clumsily edited I can only think that the system is being gamed. This reminds me of the John Locke fiasco. NONE of the plot is believable. Firstly there is no way that TV is live broadcast - it has to have a time loop in place to stop offensive or illegal material being broadcast. Remember Janet Jackson? There is no way that a reward could be paid to a successful killer, anyone involved in trying to would be imprisoned very quickly. As for the technical and forensic aspects, this seems to be written by someone who has watched one or two Police procedural shows but failed to understand them. Cell phones do not need to be answered in order to track them. Maybe they had a tracking ""crystal ball"" like the one they used to find a surfer on a beach at night. Don't know why they would bother, the idea of the FBI hiring a private citizen on the basis that he could do a job that they couldn't is puerile. There is no way that a radio DJ could deliberately put lives at risk and not immediately end up in a cell.

"I've read some fairly good short stories lately on my Kindle from the free selections, but the five in this collection didn't do a whole lot for me.  They aren't really horror, in my opinion, but they have a little suspense.  I think the best one is ""Bringing it Up.""  This story has a message to it, and the others really don't. They don't really have to have a moral message in horror, but it was nice to see how this character's life was carried out and the consequences that his past had on him when confronted with it.  What disappointed me most of all about these was the endings.  The writing isn't all that bad, although there are some errors left in, but the endings seemed to just fizzle out after several pages of the story.  The story, ""You Remember"" was okay, but very predictable.

"I am not impressed with this installment in the series.  I agree with many that the first two were much better than this offering.  I did appreciate the history of the lead characters Pip and Jeff.  Their combined past experiences explained alot behind their beliefs and actions.  I understand this this is an ongoing series, but with the other stories, the lead characters' story was pretty much wrapped up at the end of the book.  This story was not cohesively written, and that ended up being a distraction.  After everything that happened between Pip and Jeff, the manner in which the ending was handled did not leave the impression they would necessarily end up together.  There were too many issues between them that were not resolved for that to happen.I see on Amazon that this series was just released in November 2009, but I originally purchased the first two books when they were released by Ellora's Cave over two years ago.  I don't know if the break between the books in the series had an impact or not, but I was not impressed with this one.

"We begin the novel in medias res (or in the middle) with the main character, Grace, going into labor with her children and her beloved partner (who re-names un-named) by her side.Then we quickly go back to a year earlier when she is celebrating her birthday with her long-time boyfriend Mark and their closet friends. We find out that Grace is feeling pressured by Mark to have a baby though she rather they actually get married first.It took me a long time to formulate what I had a problem with in this novel. I think the main problem that I found was that not only did the plot just border on the ridiculous throughout, but when we get to the climax and ending it just turned into a downright unbelievable novel.For Ms. Downing to write the character of Mark and her relationships with her girlfriends the way she did and then have the ending she wrote was just flat out trying to tie a bow on things to make it a happy ending (where none is deserved).In the end I didn't care for the main protagonist (she complains a lot about her life though she has it pretty well) and with my attention waning, I started wishing that I had selected another novel to read.I think there were certain elements there to make it into a good book but certain things would have to be re-worked to make it believable to readers who would want to read more by this author one day.",Pass (2 Stars),1367280000,2,2,2,-1

"Another collection of short stories, and like the first anthology (No Good Deed), the connection to the River City novels is in there, it's just not always prevalent. And similar to the first anthology, the final product is uneven at best. There are a few good stories, but many of the offerings remind me of what a high school course of Beginning Story-Writing would produce. Some of these are so bad they left me seriously considering abandoning the rest of the book. Instead of 17 short stories, many of which were too short on plot, detail, and ending, I'd have preferred half as many stories with somewhat more complete and conclusive plotlines. The book's final story (Alan Hart) was well worth the price of admission, but I had to slog through an uneven bunch of good, so-so, and downright bad stories to get there.

"I found the original series to be pretty good, not great but good. So when i found another book in the same world i was curious. This book could by and large be on its own with only a few tweaks. The world as you know it is gone. Several hundred years have passed since the last book and the story of the chosen is now distorted legend. Somehow it seems as though the north has again split into three kingdoms and that the world has gone stupid.Something apparently happened to make not only the split occur, but to have all people fear knowledge. Books, those to write or read them are outcasts from society. Sometimes even being killed. The problem is we are not told why that is. You would think that such a huge change would require an explanation, but the author saw differently apparently. As someone who read the first three books i found this a huge disappointment. Only one character makes an appearance  and we are not told WHY they are doing what they are doing(the why they are doing it the WAY they are is easy though). They are seen only on occasion and are only used as a plot device to puch the story along.On its own it is an okay but short book, but when you have read the original series it comes off as a waste of time, an attaemt for quick cash, and a blot on the authors otherwise good series.",Waste,1323561600,5,5,2,-1

"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for.

The characters were fairly 2-dimensional, and didn't always display an internal consistency in how they were portrayed, but then the story wasn't really about character development.  There were several scenes that were just thrown in for no reason I could see - they didn't actually advance the story - and they served only to detract from the true thread of the story.  I also got the feeling that as the story progressed, the author started to feel that her 'good guys' weren't good enough and her 'bad guys' not bad enough, so started to lay on additional details to more firmly push them to one side or the other. The extra information just sort of lay on top of what had gone before and made the reader wonder what purpose it was supposed to serve.Not recommended.Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good - but a well-formatted book does not make up for lack of good writing.",How high should my disbelief be suspended?,1341878400,0,0,2,-1

"After reading the other reviews I purchased this title and was disappointed.  This isn't a different story and the characters were poorly developed.  The slaves at Cascade (and in this society), don't ""choose"" to be slaves in the sense that they have options.  Generally, in this society if you don't have a job or training you become a slave.  Alex, is an anomaly in that he one of the few who chooses slavery because of his specific sexual needs and he is older-47 years old.  He has a trade, makes a living but his submissive nature calls him to slavery.  His situation is very different than most of the other slaves we meet:  Noah, Jackson, and Gavin.  Gavin's experience as a slave led him to refuse to even consider owning a slave until Alex comes along.  And this is a huge problem in the continuity of the character development of Gavin.  Alex is the first slave he's trained who is actually choosing to become a slave when he has more attractive alternatives (from Gavin's point of view).  As a result, he's overprotective, holds back and goes ""easy"" on Alex while trying to convince him that slavery is the wrong choice for him.  None of this makes sense-why does Gavin choose to help out the one person who is looking forward to becoming a slave and would happily go with any of the men who take him for a test drive-the rougher the better.  One would think that he would have chosen, before this point,  to help out someone in dire straits-terrified, young, no options, but not Gavin he waits until someone comes to him who has options, is old enough to make a decision and indeed has thought about it and is only offering a 6 month contract so if this gig doesn't work out he can go back to his trade.  Very different than many of the other slaves we meet who have years of slavery to look forward to-again it would make more sense to help one of those people out.I did enjoy the relationship between Sam and Gavin, it was friendly and loving but given that they both had dominant natures I found it very odd, and hard to believe, that they didn't have a third in their relationship, someone very submissive to offset their dominance.  Sure, for the most part Sam let Gavin dominate him, but he wasn't really satisfied with that-as we see in the scene with Jackson when Demetri says ""how have you lived without this""?  I think, as readers, we're supposed to understand that this has been missing from Sam and Gavin's relationship and Alex's presence in their home would provide this. But again, that person did not have to be a slave. Alex would have been happy to go to Michael, Demetri even Brian and Rhys.  He wasn't looking for love, he wanted to be hurt and any of those men would have been happy to provide that.  I thought it was hilarious when they called Alex ""boy"" he was 47 years old for crying out loud!So the big conflict-Gavin not wanting to own a slave because he hated his time in slavery made no sense because Alex wanted to be a slave and Gavin worked as a fricking slave trainer, he had no problem, no conflict with his job.  And he was acting like an owner because he was totally ignoring Alex's desires.  Sam's arguments in favor of Alex making his own choices were good ones, but he was a fricking slave owner.  He only stopped owning slaves when he hooked up with Gavin-he had no problem using slaves whether or not they choose to be in the situation or not.  I felt like the author was trying to write Sam and Gavin as empathic and fair and totally missed the mark-they were poorly fleshed out and delusional.However, Alex was consistent and well developed.  The character of Demetri was fascinating.",Disappointed,1330732800,0,0,2,-1

"I felt like I was watching a cheap, low budget soap opera, and stopped reading this book before I finished it, because, frankly, I could care less what happens with this woman's love life.  The characters were all 1 dimensional, and that may be too high of a complement.This book hops around.  One minute you are reading about the lead character in present day, and then suddenly, for no reason, it hops back to a time when she was in college helping the guy she is currently in love with to study for finals, with no apparent reason for this flashback.  Other books, when they have a flashback, it's to recall an earlier crisis or introduce HOW two characters met, etc.  This just seemed like someone had mixed up all the pages of the book and put this section in out of order.And then there is a scene referring to a character who is this teenager out walking with his girlfriend and he asks her to marry him.  We have never even been introduced to this girlfriend before, and it isn't even really clear who this teen is who is out walking with his girlfriend.  He is referred to by the same name as the local landscaper's son, so I am assuming that it is supposed to be him, but I just couldn't see WHY they had to throw in this kid, who had only had a small part up till then (doing landscaping scenes), suddenly proposing to a previously un-introduced girlfriend.And then the lead character has a friend, who in an effort to console her after her attempt to get the old college friend to declare his love for her doesn't work, this male friend suddenly announces, ""hey, let's try it out and see if we can be a couple"".","I wanted ""More"" from this book--NOT a good read!",1294444800,4,4,1,-1

"This is the third of Ms. Druga's EOTWAWKI books I've read.  'Dust' was okay-ish, 'Sealed In' was real good, but this one reads like a first draft.  It has major editing, sentence structure, missing word, wrong word (I stopped counting at 15), research, continuity, and suspension of disbelief issues. These problems become more and more pronounced as the story progresses.To a greater or lesser extent, this seems to be a recurring problem with all of Ms. Druga's literary efforts.The story opens with the main protagonist Jen using a scope mounted rifle to shoot an infected.  Later on, when this same event is described, she uses a shotgun.The character Mack, a supposed expert 'gun maker and repairman' (the term for which, by the way, is 'gunsmith'), instead talks like an author who has no real grasp of firearms and firearms technology.  Later on in the story, Mack builds 'an anti-aircraft gun' and shoots down two ground attack aircraft with it.  'Anti-aircraft gun' is all the description given; no clue as to caliber, system of operation, or any other detail.I found the author's woefully inadequate grasp of military terms, tactics, equipment and operations particularly annoying.  It's just as easy to do a little research and get this stuff right as it is to just make stuff up based on what you think you know.And the same caveat with the fancy words - it's not a bad idea to make sure you actually know what they mean before you use them.Handled differently and given more (any) fact-checking, editing, and attention to detail, this could have been a hell of a read.

Truvy has called her in a panic, afraid of her live-in boyfriend, Jake.The action takes place at an indeterminate time (at one point, we're told something was difficult ""in those days,"" but we -- as readers -- have no earthly idea what ""those days"" are).  The behaviors of the characters are ripped straight from the afterschool special zone -- nobody feels real or authentic. The story has a point to make about how the system lets women and children down.  Unfortunately, it sacrifices the elements of decent fiction to make that point.The words chosen by the author are often unnecessarily florid or used slightly incorrectly, creating an unintentionally comic effect.  There are also spelling issues (at one point a character demands to know if another character is ""Kojack,"" while the Telly Savalas character is ""Kojak.""  The ending of the story, which comes after much back-and-forth meandering, is frustratingly abrupt.",Not sure what the author was trying to do here,1365984000,0,0,2,-1

"..it is a short story. So why are there chapters?

"The premise of this book gave me high hopes for the adventures that would happen within its pages, but unfortunately I was disappointed. The book starts off with Mina doubting her relationship with her long time boyfriend Sam and feeling smothered by him simply because she sees a hot guy. Enter Blake, who is apparently so perfect and gorgeous he fails to get any type of personality beyond the cliche of the tortured bad boy who is actually a Nice Guy. Things change so quickly between Mina and Sam that their whole relationship is pretty much pointless. Sam is disposed of very conveniently early on, and I'm left to wonder if the book would have been a lot better without his character. Sam is really only the catalyst to keep Mina and Blake apart a bit longer and to distance Mina from her friends since they disapprove of Blake. The whole ""relationship"" between Mina and Blake is just so quick and based on nothing, that I couldn't even appreciate the few moments that were cute. ""Love"" based on destiny and the fact that a couple HAS to be together because it was written that way really offends me. What about free will and choice?Who is Mina? I'm not quite sure. Despite the fact that she is narrating the book, I feel like I have no clue who she is and what she is interested in, besides Blake. Sometimes I didn't really know what was happening at all, in fact. What exactly IS The Realm? I actually don't even have a clue. There's all this mysticism going on, with some immortal characters from the past and some that are mortal, but somehow related to people from Arthurian times. I just have absolutely no clue how it all works. It's fine to leave a bit of mystery, but when the reader doesn't understand anything about the world you've built (or failed to build), I think that's a problem.There is a lot of foreshadowing of doom and gloom at the beginning of the book which is annoying, especially because those levels of said doom and gloom didn't really seem to appear. Yes, bad stuff happened. But apocalyptic, everything is doomed levels of gloom? Not so much. Everything in the book seems a bit disjointed, in fact. There are random details about the background characters thrown in just for the heck of it, it seems, because they definitely didn't serve any purpose to the greater story. Add in some grammar mistakes and major formatting issues with the eBook version of the novel, and it leads me to believe there was very little proofreading.The last fifty pages of the book are infinitely better and more interesting than the rest of the book, and the ending feels like an entirely different book with how intriguing and well written it is. When I finished reading the book I admit that I was curious about what will happen next, but not enough to pick up the next book. The deficiencies that plague the majority of this story will definitely prevent me from reading on in this saga.",Not for me,1308528000,13,13,2,-1

I don't know how old she was, but she seemed to me to be a young, selfish, stubborn, spoiled, indecisive, dim-witted drama queen.

"I read books not only because I love to read about new characters and their adventures, but also because I want to write. I am currently hard at work on the fourth rewrite of my manuscript, and some of the best places I look to for inspiration are other books. Seeing how the author flows the action, how they make the characters come alive, how they draw me in, gives me fresh ideas on how to make my own writing better. So when I read and review novels, I am not just reviewing as a reader, but also as a writer. I just wanted to add that little disclaimer before I get into my next review.Sammi Ever After, the debut novel from Soma Helmi has a great plot. Sammi, a young girl in her twenties, finds a friend from childhood and instantly falls in love, preparing to move across the world just to be with him. It's her fairy tale come true. Until she arrives at the airport only to find out she has been dumped- over an email. Fairy tale broken. When Sammi finally forces herself off her friend's couch and secures a job and new friends, she decides to take a little journey to try to search for that fairy tale ending. From London to Bali to Greece, Sammi gets tangled in sticky situations and personal revelations, and realizes that her Prince Charming may have been by her side the entire time.Like I said, I think the plot is fantastic. A great story about self-discovery and love, and I am a huge travel geek, so reading about all these destinations I hope to visit had me amped to read this story. But once I started, the writing fell flat to me. Helmi relied on flashbacks and back story when introducing characters, much that was simply not needed and unnecessary to the story. For each flashback, I felt myself became less engaged in the action. Another problem I had was the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I don't know anyone who would actually describe someone's look aloud by saying ""His sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes and the way his muscles ripple..."" That could be the thoughts of someone, but for a person (especially a young girl) to describe someone else that way? It just wasn't believable for me. So as much as I would have liked this plot and the characters that came along for the ride, I do not feel the writing did the story justice.",Sammi Ever After,1289260800,2,2,2,-1
"I enjoyed the first book in this series, Cutthroat Business, and was looking forward to the second installment.  Unfortunately, Hot Property was mostly just a repeat of the same story.

That I can respect as Mrs. Martin appears to be a disingenuous, narrow minded person.However, I don't have much regard for someone who is so willing to not only look the other way, but also protect a criminal when she is convinced of his guilt.I'm fairly certain that the story plays out that all is not as it seems, but having this happen over the course of several books is asking too much of the reader, especially if the other books in the series follow the same pattern of rehashing what has come before.I think I will quit while I am ahead with this series as I can read from the product descriptions of the upcoming books about the highlights without having to slog through endless repetition and silliness.",Rehash of the First Book,1347667200,5,5,1,-1

"Alexandra Riley has no idea about her heritage. Has no idea her father's a werewolf until the day she becomes hunted. That's the day Joshua Striker shows up in her father's garage.Being a Striker is more than just a name. Amongst the Wolf Creek pack, they are judge, jury, and executioner when need be. His job now is to take Alex back to North Carolina where she'll be safe from males on the hunt for a mate, bounty hunters and werewolves who think mixed breeds like Alex should be put down.The premise sounded almost breathtaking for a paranormal fan like me, but I had a heck of a time getting into this one. The story began interesting enough, but I found it hard to believe Joshua was as feared as claimed, like what I was told clashed with what I was being shown. That was only one example. There were a few more awkward spots of inconsistency with the characters and their personality.The action scenes were the best. I also enjoyed the secondary characters, but the romance scenes fell flat for me. I simply wasn't feeling it.",Book One of the Legacy Series,1318204800,1,1,2,-1
"This was a very good story.  BUT, and that's a very big 'but' and also the reason I only gave 1 star is that it reads like a Sample story you'd get off one of the other e-books on Amazon.  At first I thought it was one because it didn't finish, but it is in the right category.  This is all you get folks.The story mentions some paranormal abilities that the Heroine has, but you never actually see them in use.  The end just drops off and you're never quite sure what happened to the other characters except for the mention that everyone arrived safely.  In the very last paragraph the Heroine receives a letter and you can see she's surprised, but you never know what's in the letter, or anything else.  It ends here.There is a note at the end that tells the reader that the Hero and Heroine have other stories written about them, but if they all end like this I'm mot going to bother.

"I decided to go with GoodReads two-star rating of ""it was ok"". I guess Parker just rubbed me the wrong way. One character in the book described it well by saying she had an ""ugly personality"". The reason I kept reading was because it seemed like she genuinely didn't know how she was coming off and really did want to make some changes and become a nicer person. She lost her dad and had put up some pretty big walls, but I thought she came across as just as mean, if not meaner, than the ""mean girls"" that she so desperately despised. But, at the same time there was something likable about her, maybe it was the fact that she was trying to change and does make progress. The ending wrapped up too quickly (and she ended up with someone I didn't expect), and one of the girls she hated throughout the book becomes a good friend. I wouldn't mind that storyline, but it seemed to come out of nowhere.I don't know why YA authors write leading characters that don't match up with the story. In this book for example, Parker starts off a loner with only one friend. Claims she isn't pretty and dresses like a tomboy. By the end of the book she's the prettiest girl on campus (and every guy has always thought so), wins homecoming queen and scores a super hot boyfriend. I guess it's to show that maybe we see ourselves differently than the people around us. I just don't see why we can't have a normal lead for once. Someone who has normal amount of friends, is nice, has a good personality, isn't afraid to admit their cute and ends up with someone who fits well with them. Can anyone recommend a book like that?Anyway, if you like story's with a high school setting than you might enjoy this.Content: Lots of swearing (I would have given it another star if it wasn't for the language), but otherwise clean.",It was okay,1318291200,2,2,2,-1

"In a sort of Romeo and Juliet spirit, Sydney (Juliet),  from a hunter family, falls in love with Jason (Romeo) a werewolf. She has dreamed of him over the years and meeting Jake in person, she falls in instant lust. They consume their relationship pretty quickly and he bites her, therefore starting her transformation into a full-fledged werewolf.Meanwhile, her father keeps trying to get her to hunt and kill werewolves.The hunters, who know full well the wolves they are trying to kill are human, are shown as uneducated rednecks, whose collective IQ is less than 100. The werewolves are not much better. Why they would want to run wild in the woods when they know they're in danger is never quite explained. One would think that they would have leaned to control their instinct in order to survive. Or at least do something to stop the hunt (politics, law-making and media relation anyone?)But there's worse. The relationship between Sidney and her father is unhealthy and made me cringe. She's an immature little girl looking for Daddy's attention and he does not listen nor takes her feelings seriously.

"Not only does Rogue Hunter -- Gaia: Into the Abyss not feel like a complete story in and of itself (never mind the setting to which it hints at), it reads as one written by a very inexperienced writer.  Hendrickson has a maddening tendency to be overly descriptive where few adjectives are needed, gives no sense of motion or kinetic action to the combat scenes, and feels quite comfortable in borrowing from many other sources when it comes to filling out the edges to his bounty hunter tale.  There just isn't anything here worth reading, and it is (sadly) enough for me to not give the rest of his (free on Kindle) material a chance.I would imagine this is on par with the quality a fifteen year old sci-fi fan would produce.  Yes, Hendrickson did finish the story and get it out for people to read, but I think it would have been more helpful to make a more serious attempt at addressing the idea after gaining a little more writing experience.","In need of proof-reading, an editor, and more experience as a writer",1319500800,1,1,1,-1

I think he's up to 5 or 6 now..Then of course there is the basic story line... as he explains in a forward in a novella one only bothers to really develp 2 main characters.... so there is no character development other than these two... and I would argue there is very little of that as well.. Further, there are very poor relationships between not only these two characters but also the other characters in teh story.  the wife is non existent.  the daughter is a monster.. there are no friendships... the second character follows the 'prince' apparently out of fear and a hope... that he will eventually get to fixing their lands main problem... very very dark dreary stuff here... bodies dead and alive and re awakened from the dead and re killed all over the place.... if I was a person in this land I would leave there as soon as possible and fight on the other side....these people are not rationally motivated... none of them",Don't bother,1309305600,2,2,1,-1

"The story was all over the place, I agree with the first reviewer, it was written in such a juvenile sense you'd think a kid just trying their hand at writing wrote this story.  It was all over the place, constant name dropping, events taking place that didn't make sense.  I'm going to attribute the author being incarcerated as a reason that certain things weren't researched, then again, the male character dropped african knowledge on the lead character so some research had to be done, but not enough to bring the story together.  There was no character or story development, I didn't understand half the drama because it came out of left field and it wasn't developed enough to make you feel any kind of way.  The premise of the story is actually pretty good and so much could have been done with it but the book needed to be completely rewritten with the premise in mind to make it a good story.  It could have been one, but this author just didn't get it done.  This book was so bad I couldn't help but continue to read it just to see how much worse it could really get.  And it outdid itself.  I would say the author needs to read different styles of writing to come into his own, learn story and character development, like I said great premise but it could have been written a whole lot better.  Winny Williams? 'Back in the days'? A month past her due date to have a 8lb baby? Going to rehab for marijuana? It's a BUNCH of other things that will make you say, huh? And scratch your head.  The author possibly has a future, but much more practice is needed, you'd be okay with this book if the author was lets say between the ages of 12-17 and just started writting just because, handed in the manuscript with little editing and turned it into book form.

"Summary:  Dermot MacKay is a Druid Laird from 6th century.  He and the warriors from his clan have been cursed with immortality after the death of Dermot's wife during an attack on their keep.  Dermot's wife was part Fae and had to give up her immortality in order to marry him.  After her death, her mother Anya placed the curse on Dermot to punish him for allowing her daughter to die.The only way to break the curse is to find his wife's reincarnated soul in the body of another human and return her to the place of her death on the anniversary of her death.  Finally, in current day Minneapolis, Dermot finds his wife's soul in the body of Sidney St. George.Although the only thing Dermot had ever wanted was a mortal death, meeting Sidney makes him wish for a mortal life instead.  While struggling with his attraction to Sidney, he must also convince her to help his clan by returning with him to Scotland.  Along the way, Dermot and Sidney begin to fall in love.  Can there be a happy ending when death is around the corner?The path back to Scotland is not without peril.  Anya is not willing to let Dermot out of the curse, and she will do anything to stop them.Review:  I listened to the audio book version of this book, and right out of the gate I loved the narrator, Chloe Campbell.  Her Scottish burr for the male characters was phenomenal and definitely added a feel of authenticity.  If I ever get to Scotland one day, that Scottish accent is going to have me crushing on every man who talks to me.  No wonder I love Celtic love stories.With that said, the story itself was ho-hum.  The plot started out interesting, but never went anywhere.  The men have to bring Sidney to Scotland to break the curse, and Anya wants to stop them.  That is about it.  Sidney and Dermot have this constant push and pull thing going on between them, but it is far more irritating than it is captivating.  It was repetitive and trivial.  Sidney and her best friend Zoe use outdated phrases and slang, making the book sound like it was written a couple of decades ago instead of being a contemporary 2011 novel.There is a major storyline about Dermot not telling Sidney the big ""secret"" about the possibility that he might die when the curse is lifted.  But if she had a brain in her head at all, the thought would have occurred to her.  Besides her complete lack of intuition, Sidney's personality and argumentative nature were equivalent to fingernails on a chalkboard.  She refers to Anya as ""scary faerie"" throughout the entire book like a little girl might.  I found myself wondering why anyone would make this annoying woman the main character in a love story.The secondary characters of Thomas and Zoe were a lot more fun than Dermot and Sidney.  I even preferred reading about Anya, the Fae villain.  I would have liked the book better if more time was spent on these characters.Anyhoo, if I hadn't enjoyed the audio narrator, I'm not sure I would have finished the book.  I found it very disappointing, particularly since I'm always on the hunt for good Scottish novels.",Incredibly annoying female lead character,1326067200,6,6,2,-1

"This book had the potential to be good, but I don't know what happened.Abby was once married to a famous artist named Benedict who died at a young age. The day after he died, Abby meets and sleeps with Ryan who she happens to get pregnant by. She decides to pass the child (Trish) off as her late husbands because no one knows about Ryan.At a gallery showing for her late husbands artwork, Abby is bombarded with questions and comments from all of these pretentious and fake people trying to keep Ben's memory alive. One of the worse ones is Hans Bunian. Hans is also an artist that her late husband Ben admired and that she made the Godfather to her daughter.Hans convinces Abby that her daughter should become a artist and has her taking art lessons and creating art. Hans is also a Bully, who acts more like the child is his instead of hers. Abby doesn't seem to have a backbone and allows Hans not only to bully her but, also her daughter.10 years after their first encounter, Abby sees Ryan again at the Gallery and immediately tried to avoid him because she doesn't want him to find out about his daughter. After a few encounters, Ryan figures out that Trish is his daughter and decides that he isn't going to allow Hans to continue to Bully his daughter or Abby.Ryan is a refreshing part of the book, the only part that I really liked.This story was so unrealistic, I mean who allows not only them self but, also their own child to be bullied by someone when all that they have to do is break all contact with them?",Pretentious Much???,1388016000,5,5,2,-1

"I just didn't care for this.  I get irritated by the announement some indies use at the beginning of the book that pretty much forbid you to ""share the book"" with another and say purchase they're own copy.

The one love scene was like two paragraphs and seemed to end with him being the only one satisfied.. Could have been a good book with just one but it fell short with the other issues. Also, every man that sees her wants her; come on! The thought of every man that you encounter wanting to take you to dinner is a little much and not realistic. The book ends with her going back to him like he did something like forgetting to buy milk. He fired her and she was left broke. I don't like unpredictable authors, be great and then average.

"I'm surprised this book was published in 2011 because it includes techniques such as double escrow that are basically outdated (additionally unethical or even illegal in some situations). I've practiced real estate in PA and CO and both states basically preclude double escrows. Title companies won't issue the title on such a deal. If you hold a real estate license, you also risk having your license yanked.Other reasons this book is ridiculous:1. There is no secret to getting a pre-foreclosure list. Just contact your title company and you can usually get a NOD list. Just keep in mind that each person on that pre-foreclosure list is getting a flood of phone calls and mail from other people hoping to make millions from reading this ridiculous book (and other books).2. In many municipalities, you can't do door-to-door solicitations like he describes in the book. This leaves you with sending mail.

"As an avid lover of fairytales revamped for adults, I literally devoured ""Mrs. Beast"" in one sitting. I began reading it around 10p.m. and I stayed up until about 2 a.m. It was that good. I loved how Elora had her finger in every fairytale ""pie"" and her interactions with her poor, mistreated mutt.The sequel starts out strong, but as soon as the protagonist, Rune (the daughter of Beauty and the Beast) goes on a quest to find the Hedgehog turned Prince that she is infatuated with, the story rapidly begins to lose steam. I think the problem is Ms. Ditchoff used and elaborated on the backstory of so many better known, more interesting fairytale characters all the well known, more interesting fairytale heroines in her first book, leaving her to really scrape for more to use in this one and the characters are, for lack of a better word, lame and completely one-dimensional. Or perhaps she was rushed when she wrote the sequel and was not able to take the same amount of time and care she put into the first to really expand upon her characters.I found myself unable to connect or really care about Rune or all the characters in the story the way I did when I read Mrs. Beast. Plus, the characters who share their tales are so unfamilar to me, that I felt kind of lost and my interest wanned.For example, Rune meets the Bog King's daughter who takes FOREVER to tell her boring story which could have been summed up in a paragraph. Basically this is her backstory: Mom is raped by the Bog King, daughter is born and turns into a 80lb frog each night(sounds like Fiona from Shrek...). Priest comes to village, then Bog daughter escapes to Egypt with Mom, turns back into a princess, then goes to Heaven with the Priest, returns to earth and finds that 100 years have passed, so now she is a bolt of lightening for all eternity that works for Elora. Um...yeah...okay...Elora is a lot more subdued in the story and her interactions with her mutt don't sizzle with the same humor and irony. I forced myself to continue reading, but it was unenjoyable and a big let down.Because of the strength of Mrs. Beast, I would be willing to give a third book by Ms. Ditchoff a try, but if it dissapoints me as much as Princess Beast, then I won't be purchasing anymore.",The Prequel Was Better,1289692800,7,7,2,-1

"I am sadly disappointed in both Amazon and the author for letting this book go to publication before proofing it properly. I read a short story, Wicked Mourning, by author Heather Boyd, before venturing into her novel length work - and it was fine. A few hiccups here and there; typos, jumbled sentences, etc, but I figured it was a minor piece, someone had rushed the work to get it out there, and would be more careful about proofing a novel.Apparently not. Seeing errors every few pages will get annoying that much faster if you know you have about four hundred more to go..Storywise, the book is fine. Somewhat unimaginative and predictable, but I wasn't expecting Shakespeare when I bought it, just a nice little period piece. However, it was ruined for me, by the countless and repetitive mistakes. A historical romance should not leave you praising higher powers that you have finally, after struggling for days, reached the final page. It should leave you wanting more - and I almost did end up buying the next installation after reading the teaser at the end of this one.

"I got this book in exchange for a honest review.I actually read the entire book - the content did not keep me interested the entire time and I was trying to tell myself that it would get better.  However, it gets worse later on.  I mean the plot was a nice thought.  A vampire who is a direct descendant of Count Dracula (ok, he's his long-lost son) happened to be on the run because he killed someone.  I like the books that has vampires in it, but this one had to be the worst one I have ever read.  I'm sorry, Janet Parfitt.  I tried to like it...The book also jumped to different characters' perspective and I got a little lost in the beginning but I got used to it after reading it.  However, the writing was just horrible.  I felt like I was reading a middle-schooler's story.  Heck, I was thinking of the students I used to work with and they would write something like this.  They were 5th and 6th graders.  The dialogue was really awkward and the actions were awkward.  I felt it was also a little too fast when it could use a little more elaboration.  But I couldn't really enjoy it at all.As I mentioned, it did get worse later on.  It's like the author tried her best in the beginning, then it gets sloppy and there were some scenes that did not make ANY sense to me.  I kept shaking my head to try to stop analyzing the scenes because I told myself that it would make any less sense if I think more about it.  I think it was trying to be funny in some way but it failed with me.  Maybe other readers will see it differently, and if that's the case, great.

In my opinion, there was no chemistry between any of the characters.  While, I do not think it is unrealistic that a 50 year old woman can be beautiful and desirable to a younger man, being the object of desire to virtually every man with whom she comes in contact is.  I started rolling my eyes every time a new character came in that just had to have her.  I was hoping for a sweet romance, but didn't get that.  This book's saving grace was that it was well written which seems to be a rare occurrence for IR romance.  I am really thinking about walking away from the IR genre altogether.

"I like mystery. I like humor. I like it when it is well put together. When it's not, a story can be hard to follow. Jayde Scott had a good idea in Born to Spy that just did not grab me.It is a story of a teenage boy who finds his father has disappeared. In trying to figure out where he is, Thom finds out that his father is a spy. With the help of his best friend and his friend's sister, these teenagers set out on a wild adventure involving art, guns, and spies.I found the story a little hard to read because there was too much comedy within it. It was too unreal for me. Scenes where any teenager would be scared or more serious were just times of comical exchanges between the teens. I tried to see it as a movie as that sometimes helps to bring out what the author intended. That still did not work. I could not see any teenager acting like this. Then again, I'm an adult. So I brought in a teenager.My son started the book but could not finish it. He was confused with how the characters interacted and felt that there was too much comedy in it which took away from the story line and rendered the characters unbelievable. He said he could not connect to it.I don't recommend that you skip this book because of my inability to connect to it or my son's. Everyone is completely different with different literary works appealing to them. You'll find reviews of people who loved the story. For the extremely reasonable price of the kindle edition, I highly recommend you check it out if you have a young adult, are a young adult, and like mystery and comedy mixed together.For me, it was not one I'd highly recommend, but I would not discourage you from checking out.

"Going Home starts off very amusingly. I was instantly attracted to the characters (not, ooh he's so hot, but I love them!), unfortunately, it was down hill from there. I really thought I was going to love this book, but after the first chapter, the book starts to disappoint.For one thing, Emily is attracted to far too many men, and just in the first couple of chapters! She's flighty and annoying, and I started to resent her. I do not like women who are ditzy and immature. They get on my nerves, and I kinda just wanna go up and smack them and say, ""Act your age, idiot!""Which brings me to my next point. I can't tell if Ms. Dennis's writing is juvenile, or if Emily is. From her taste in clothes, to her favorite ""vampire book series"" I can't tell if she's in her twenties or her early teens. She acts like some of the girls I used to go to school with. Her annoying obsession with shopping also grates on my nerves. Sorry if I sound obsessive, myself, but I'm just stating how I feel.I always say I like a good, descriptive story, but there is a point where the author is going to far. For example, In Going Home the author tells us about the stripes on Emily's bikini and what is in the sauce at a restaurant. It's irrelevant and distracts from the important parts of the story.Emily's relationships with Jacob and Pete move way to fast. Even if Emily and Pete are starting where they left off a date within the first three or four chapters is quite speedy. Not only are the relationships going too fast, each scene in the book is, as well. I understand if Ms. Dennis is trying to make it so a reader doesn't get bored, but how can we get to know a character or what's going on plot-wise if the story is moving at an outlandish speed? Just a thought...This book is too mainstream! Addicted to shopping, in love with shopping, loves to sing pop at the top of her lungs...what is new about Emily? I'll be honest, I love vampires (especially hotties with six pacts and gorgeous eyes), but when I was reading this novel I felt like I've read about Emily over and over. It's boring. It needs something new, unique, unheard of. That's how you become best-seller. Take the Twilight series. Even if people aren't so much into Edward and Bella, at least ""sparkling vampires"" was a new thing.I'm not here to be rude and nag, but I need to tell the truth, my opinion. To make readers interested, it takes pizazz and originality, and I'm afraid Going Home isn't any of the sort.Recommendations??Honestly, I'm stuck. I have no idea  who would enjoy this. Mainstreamers?

"This is quite likely the worst grammer I have ever come across in a published book. This author consistently uses ""new"" when she should use ""knew"" and ""to"" when she should use ""too"". She also doesn't know the difference between breath and breathe. These are just some of the more prevalent examples, there were others. I also became tired of all the blushing going on. I searched, and there are 44 instances of the word blush and that doesn't catch all the times people just turn red. The most annoying part of that, is that most of them were the big bad alpha hero who turns into a tiger.The style of story and plot seemed more like a young adult title but there was too much adult content for that to be the case. The story itself had lots of potential. I probably would have rated it four stars if it were not for the nearly illiterate writing.This story ends rather abruptly and is apparently continued in the next book of the series.

A character is shopping and next paragraph she is doing something else without any transition.  This constantly changing point of view AND constantly changing location without warning made the book just seem frentic and confusing.

"I downloaded this book hoping for a spectacular story, only to be disappointed. The first part, where Darcy runs away because of her stepfather's actions was okay, if scantily written, however things went downhill from there.The story jumps to 12 years later and Jordan is a writer whose mother, Stella, has cancer. As they have no money, he feels forced to sell Darcy's story to make money for her treatment. Darcy by this time, of course, is a famous artist working under a pseudonym and eight years ago became a recluse, only talking to her best friend Lisa, who has an ""un-natural"" attachment to her. Darcy, by the way, can only paint horror pictures  :(Jordan tries for three months to contact Darcy who is too busy wallowing in self pity to speak to him. Then finally he turns up on her doorstep and she deigns to sleep with him for revenge after the book comes out, then dumps him. He of course, has broken off with a perfectly nice girlfriend for this nasty little piece of work! You can see where this is heading can't you?Accused of the murder of her stepfather, the stupid woman refuses to tell the police that she was at a refuge which she bought for teenage runaways in case people found out it was there - as if the police wouldn't know about it and keep her association with it quiet!Why a young man like Jordan would bother chasing after a thoroughly unpleasant, cowardly woman like Darcy is beyond me but then again, he's an absolute burk for bothering about her when she dumps him after sleeping with him.Katherine Shay's writing is lacklustre, there is no depth to the characters and entirely too much ""telling"" rather than ""showing.""

"Lady Catherine and Baron Borgeault have been married for seven years.The Baron is a pig and the marriage is not a happy one. He has a pair of horses he wants to sell. He invites Adam Stanford Earl of Ashworth to visit his home with a view to selling the Earl the horses. This is where the Earl first lays eyes on the Baron's very beautiful wife Catherine.This is a romance but it is far from romantic IMO. Although initially we are lead to dislike Baron Borgeault, I very soon came to pity him, he was a poor tormented soul, and although he treated his wife poorly, she for her part had never once in seven years of their marriage made any attempt to pierce his defences and try to discover how to help him. I found her weak and vain, with no backbone. My own personal objection to this story is that it is based on adultery, not my favourite theme for a story.

"This will teach me to be carried away by rave reviews. I should know better but there are lots of very admiring reviews on ths here. No doubt I'll be slated for my opinion given how many think otherwise. But here goes. It starts out ok - the only early gripe was the writing style which is a bit lacking, simplistic. It is hard to describe without using the words pulp fiction. Which has come to mean something else. I see this style as belonging on supermarket shelves - mass fiction which needs no thought. And then the story. It is a good premise, the kind of is he isn't he . Childhood memories that are missing and therefore our killer could be our author. Even he does not know. I worked it out half way through. I lost patience then with our hero's stupidity and interest along with it. I skimmed to the end although tempted to abandon ship but I was promised a twist after all. Ha, should have known better! One word can sum this up - predictable. It has been years since I read Stephen King to whom this author is compared in some of these rave reviews. From what I remember of Mr. King I see no resemblence. Stephen King is a master of suspense.

"This novel fits it's boring title perfectly. It contains both steam powered machines, magic, and it is incredibly generic and bland.The steam technology feels like a tacked on gimmick to take advantage of the popularity of the steampunk genre. The technology doesn't really play any sort of role in the story besides providing a backdrop for a tired romance.The plot revolves loosely around vampires, I'm sorry, Vampyres, attempting to assemble an old machine that makes a potion that would allow them to blend into society. However, the vampyres are curiously absent from most of the tale, appearing only three times during the course of the novel and each time they seem to get weaker. At first Sir Merrick struggles to take on two by himself. During the second attack he alone takes out 5 or 6 of them. And by the end he seems to be mowing them down by the dozen.The plot crawls along at a snail's pace, going into mind-numbingly detailed accounts of perfectly ordinary dinners, parties, evenings at the park, and so on.The central love story isn't really that interesting either. Merrick and Caroline are attracted to each other, but society keeps them apart. Only, wait, no it doesn't, let's get married, the end.Honestly, don't waste your money on this generic, tasteless fluff.

"First Kill All The Lawyers by Patricia Clark has great start but fizzles at the end. What drew me to this book was the premise of a serial killer targeting lawyers. What a promising premise, unfortunately Clark doesn't deliver on the promise.The beginning of the story is strong as Clark pairs up a grizzled street cop and a FBI profiler. They are exact opposites so the reader is set-up for the personality conflicts that will undoubtedly arise as the duo pursues the serial killer but these conflicts never happen because Clark regulates the street cop to the background of the story soon after the beginning. The whole story takes a nose dive at this point.As the story continues the reader has to constantly battle to suspend disbelief. For example, a brother and sister who both happen to be FBI agents stationed in the Washington D.C. area. A stretch at best but I'm willing to make it to stay in the story. However, Clark includes a famous country singer for a love interest who happens to have an uncle who is ex-CIA, who will conveniently provide all the clandestine help necessary to solve the case. This pushed suspension of disbelief to the utmost limits.The corny characters were bearable but what wasn't bearable was the ending. Clark builds the story and prepares the reader for a great climatic battle between the serial killer and the protagonist only there is no battle, just revelation of the identity of the killer.First Kill All The Lawyers had the makings of a great yarn then it just fizzled.

"I wanted to like this book. It started out promising and then dragged. I actually put the book down and came back to it four days later. I NEVER DO THAT!

She also was very good at showing their insecurities and putting their emotions and fears into their inner dialogue. I understood both main characters and they drew me in. They were not enough to win me over.The bad: One of the worst covers I have seen in a long time. It does nothing to draw in the reader. The story itself needs editing. Some words were wrong, say instead of stay. Also jarring transition from some paragraphs. The story didn't flow. I would turn the page and have to go back. The ""mystery"" was also lame. It was over simplified, as if for a child to figure out. This felt like a rough draft, or the first book by a struggling author who hasn't found her voice yet.Overall, I give it 2 stars. I'm frustrated with the glut of books available of amazon that are sub-par. This could have been good, but it was rushed to the public, or maybe it was done to make quick cash.

"Kristen Ashley has become one of my favorite romance authors. She can write.This book must have been her first, however.It is the silliest, splashiest, over the top soap opera I've read in a long time. It begins with such a mega-dose of heroine's family history, it was like listening to a co-worker tell one of those long-winded stories about their 'fascinating' second cousins.Loved the genie in the story, but the poor guy spent most of his time looking picturesque and being a foil for the perfect sweetness of his adoptive family who, gosh darn it, just never have a negative thought or trait.The heroine... oh, dear. Meet Mary Sue. She's perfect, she's beautiful, everyone falls in love with her on sight, she sacrifices herself for her daughter and even the big, bad hero is helpless against her feminine splendor. She suffers, but through no fault of her own--just the usual, y'know, death, crippling migraines, worst possible childbirth, hateful betrayals.The hero is ruthless, cold, calculating, and tough, all in the fine tradition of Harlequin tycoons. I personally love this type of hero, as they are redeemed through love. But even tho this one is a ruthless kingdom-maker, he is apparently not smart enough to keep track of the heroine and loses her for 8 years. Really? He moved her into his flat and didn't get her cell phone number?? He didn't call America to check on her when she suddenly and uncharacteristically disappeared??Not sure what happened in the end with their wildly swinging relationship, because for the first time, I didn't finish a KA book.","Big, Splashy Soap Opera ... with a Genie",1387584000,5,5,2,-1

"This is the second ""book"" in the series (though the author chooses to call them books, it's more like a serial story -- in both, the action cuts off mid-scene without resolving any plot points).  At the time of this writing, the average review for the first book is two stars and the average review for this book is three stars.  While this story is slightly better than ""Bitten,"" I think the review score has mostly benefited from the fact that the first is so bad that the only people who would read installment would be people who can't tell the difference between a good book and a bad one and people who -- for whatever reason -- don't mind taking the time to read a book that will probably be bad.  It would be a rare reader of discernment who would read the first one and then knowingly download and read this one.One of the main reasons why this installment is better is that much, much less time is spent presenting the story from Ally's point of view.  Ally's immature perspective is capable of causing unfathomable amounts of irritation in a reader of even below average intelligence.  Perplexingly, the author has made the decision to even narrate actions that are taking place from Ally's point of view in ""Ally-style"" (""Gosh, how was Ally to explain what was really going on?"").  The ""goshes"" and the ""gollies"" are mixed with R-rated language, making me wonder why on earth the author even chose to use them.  She's a heroine without a single redeeming quality.So, still way too much Ally, but less is better.  Unfortunately, a lot of the time is spent with Ben, a character who is so dumb and pathetic that you rapidly grow to hate him as well.  He's pretty much a cipher in the first story -- a vampire dedicated to finding his mate.  In this book, he's a vampire who has been parted from his mate.  He then spends most of the story doing vampire paperwork instead of looking for her.  He doesn't suspect Moira, the person who clearly has the most to gain from Ally's disappearance.  He just takes her assurances at face value.  Ben's friend, Gabe, does suspect Moira.  It's fortunate for Ally that somebody around her has a brain, even if it is somebody that she's never met.  Gabe has valid reasons to suspect Moira of being capable of evil.  Weirdly, though Ben and Gabe are best friends (and are immortal), Gabe has never had the time to tell Ben about the evil they'd done to his family.For a book supposedly about the intersections of vampire politics and romance, the world described in the novel is pretty vague.  There is a lot of talk of ""realms,"" which I think are vampire territories.  There is a vampire ""council"" and their business is important, if ill-defined.  Despite the fact that vampires can mate for life with humans, nobody seems to have many helpful details about this process (Why?  If you're immortal, wouldn't your group knowledge about things like that be huge?).Reading these books would be difficult even if the story was fantastic and the characters compelling.  Why?  The incredibly careless use of language displayed throughout.  I think English may be the author's second language.  I had my suspicions after reading the first book.  The grammar in this one is even worse.  Gemus can't even keep the same tense consistently.  You're presented with sentences like ""Could someone, from Vincent Verdon's circle, possibly saw him with Ally?""  and ""Not a sighting had been seen.""  We're far off the track of English as spoken by a native user.  The author needs to get a second set of eyes for these books to help with these pressing issues.","Better than ""Bitten"" (but is that saying much?)",1319328000,1,1,1,-1

I was much more interested in the Rezzian's, and their God's. The Pawelon's were ok, but I felt that the second book should have focused on them. To me there were to many ""main"" character's, and since they were on opposing sides it makes it difficult to root for anyone. It's under 400 pages, yet I still found myself bored.

"This book contains three interwoven stories about a rural part of lowcountry South Carolina. The stories are all historical, ranging from lost loves to Confederate ships felled by naval blockades. While the title suggests that the main thrust of the book is ghost stories, I would consider it to be more local history or folklore. Much of the story is not about after-death activities, but about what now-supposed ghosts did in life, and how they eventually met their ends. Really the stories are more legends of the past, told very much in an oral history tradition. The author displays a strong understanding of the history of the region.That said, I found it hard to connect with these stories. Perhaps that's because I was expecting a more traditional ghost story. It might also be because I've never much had an interest in traditional storytelling, and reading this felt more like listening to a storyteller than reading.I would recommend this book to people who have a particular interest in this region, the sorts of readers who would read a local history of the region.",Local History,1331251200,0,0,2,-1

"For fans of the paranormal romance genre, this short story is not a new one.  A girl has some powers that she does not know about but others in the misty realm of the paranormal know about her and her powers.  A good guy wants to save her and a bad guy wants to destroy her.It's not horrible and has some potential, but needs serious polishing.  Things in the story are a little illogical (she's attacked in an alley but her brother and friends don't take her to the hospital?) and Emily, our college-bound heroine, might be a little TSTL at moments.  Many events in the story also lack enough description.  I've read books - good books mind you - where the character conjures their power for the first time and the description of it lasts almost a whole chapter.  While that isn't reasonable for a novelette, more than a few paragraphs are called for if this power is the driving force behind their search for her.This is probably a 2.5 for me.

It sounded like an interesting story. I usually like paranormal's a lot. This one really disappointed me.There is only one view point. That view point is extremely self involved. And it is too ""wordy"" when there is no reason to be. This book could have been at least half the size with better editing, and having a second point of view would have made it more readable.The very large leaps in thinking by Meagan, without any backstory to help it, just doesn't work well. She was too self involved and too self important, then turned around and was too unsure of herself. There was no reason to be any of those things, as far as I could see. And, frankly, I just didn't like her.",Very difficult to believe or finish,1305936000,2,2,1,-1
"The plot is plain but believable and proceeds at a reasonable speed. The dialogues are fresh and light like in the previous book of the series. I liked John's character because represents a solid, coherent man while I was very disappointed by Molly who started as a mature, no-judgmental woman and finished to be easily plagiarized by her sister. Molly is very confused and confusing for the poor John. Just one example of her irritating behavior is when she stops their first kiss and then complains because John apologies and doesn't try it again. In an attempt to make the plot less predictable, the author makes Molly to suddenly realize that John (who's a cop!!!) carries a gun and, sometimes, faces harsh encounters with criminals. The result is very poor and preposterous.",disappointing,1369180800,0,0,2,-1

"Fenton is a vampire, a very lonely vampire.  In this short story ( 25 pages or so ) we are introduced to him, and sadly it then gets quite muddled with little character development.  The characters are flat and rather vague, the writer seems to have lost the urge to develop them more fully, although does provide a nice insight into the thought process of Fenton.  I wish that were developed better, so that I would have a reason to look to the series from which this is drawn.Editing was an issue, typos were scattered throughout, and there was a great lack of continuity or explanation of the missing years as this short story jumped about quite a bit.What was refreshing, and may be a draw for others, is the near asexual characterization of Fenton, and the reasonable twist into the ""thought process"" of a vampire - which up to this point is not one that we have seen to be so close to human with it's insecurities and self doubts.I don't, however, think I will judge the series based on a short story. Short story crafting is a specific talent, and many long-form authors are not necessarily adept.

"The Coming Storm!Several hundred years ago, the Wizard War tore apart the world of men, elves, and dwarves as mad sorcerers tortured innumerable captives  to gain blood magic by which they augmented their powers to godlike levels. To defend themselves, a grand alliance sprang into existence whereby the evil wizards were destroyed - except for a handful who escaped into the dark lands and out of the knowledge of the free peoples of the world.  And so, peace returned to the realms; a near universal tranquility except for political machinations at the High King's court and the constant patrol of the dark border, where tireless hunters and woodsmen from the rugged, border people and the hidden, Elven holds hunt down the dark creatures who venture into human lands at times.  All seems well with the world until now!In the Elven hold of Aerilann, Elon, advisor to the High King of Men, is filled with feelings of uneasy; his magic whispering to him of a wrongness in the land.  Thus, he begins tracking the unusually increase of dark things venturing into the border lands.  With the help of his true-friend Colath, Jareth, a human wizard, and Jalila, Elven archer, he sets out to discover the cause of his foreboding.  But will even he, the first among many, be able to read the signs in time to understand the Alliance's true danger?Ailith, the Heir to Riverford, resides in the highland kingdom of her father; a tomboyish girl, more likely to ride out to hunt dark creatures with her father's hunters than to dress in frilly gowns and read poetry.  And that is perfectly fine with her father, King Geric and her mother Selah, who adore their only daughter.  Yet, something has changed in Ailith's once loving home.  A new man, Tolan, has appeared at their tiny castle, taking up an advisor position with King Geric, and the once even-tempered and jovial king is now turning into a strange caricature of himself.  This mystifies Ailith, and when she turns to her once strong-willed mother for understanding, she finds her engulfed in a malaise as well, unable to do aught except stay in her rooms in a trance-like state.  Left adrift and alone in a world turned mad, Ailith begins her own quest to discover what has changed her parents; a quest that will change her life and place her very soul at risk.Sounds good so far, doesn't it?  Maybe a bit too Tolkienish for some but still a good premise for an engaging story.And the fact of the matter is - for all the criticisms you can make about editing or writing style - the first half of the book is a good read.  The story draws you in; the characters - especially Ailith for me - made me care about them and want to see where their differing quests led them.  But then something just goes wrong with the book.When a book goes wrong, it's like a cake recipe not turning out just right.  Did the baker not put enough sugar in?  Maybe too much?  Was an ingredient left out?  That is the way I view a good book turning out not quite right, and that is the way I view The Coming Storm: there are a few ingredients that just didn't mesh well.First, there was too much action.  The characters would go here, fight these dark creatures, then discover this new piece of the puzzles that leads them to travel to yet another place to fight more creatures.  It got to the point I just skipped the action scenes because they didnothing to actually move the story forward.Second, one of the main character evolves too quickly from powerless to powerful.  I understand that it is common fodder in fantasy books that hobbits find magic ring or farm boys discover magic sword, but those type of stories only work where the main character struggles along the way with the power.  In The Coming Storm, one character stumbles onto power after power whenever that particular power is most needed to overcome an obstacle.  And what was the other character's response to this?  Something along the lines of ""Well, I really like Steve, so while it's against the law to do this, I guess it's okay that he has this new ability to transmute stone.""  This stretched the believability factor too much for me and ruined the story for me.Third, the powerless character, who discovers all these magical talents, also turns from a follower into a leader.  A leader whom other -  more powerful and  more experienced - people just seem to automatically defer to.  When you add to this the fact that the character turns from ordinary looking into this regal, beautiful creature seemingly between pages, you might begin to understand why this whole transformation just did not ring true.Fourth, the main characters continue making these mind numbing decisions that throws them into danger; some of which just do not make any sense. The main one that keeps popping up is why this group of important people continue to travel around by themselves.  Why?  Honestly, once you've identified there is a danger and that an enemy is after you, wouldn't you go get a group of Elven hunters to accompany you around as protection or something.  There were many things like this that just made a reader go: ""What are they doing - again?""In summation, this was a very good story idea, even if it was not breaking new ground.  Somehow, the story got out of control, and Valeria Douglas tried to do too much with one character in particular.  The fact that the action became distracting rather than complimentary also speaks volumes.  Due to this, I would give the first half of the book a 3 star rating, and the book as a whole a 1 star.",Did Not Live Up To Potential,1356998400,11,11,1,-1

"David Baldacci is one of my favorite writers and I have read almost everything that he has written. However, this fails miserably as a short story.Without giving anything away, a mystery man hires a hit man and specifies a certain train for the hit man to take to reach the town where his target lives. The hit man falls asleep on the train, and when he wakes up at his destination he finds himself 50 years in the past. But being the consummate professional, the hit man simply ignores his time travel and focuses on finding his target.The time travel on the train is unoriginal, and is more appropriate for a Twilight Zone episode (there actually was one involving someone falling asleep on the train and waking up in another time). In addition, although the hit man makes a certain discovery about his target, followed by an experience that ends the story, everything that happens is very predictable and something that I easily figured out well in advance.Worse, as another review notes, Baldacci offers no explanation as to why the hit man was hired to kill this particular target, let alone any information about the background of the man who hired him (which might shed some light on motivation). As a result an ending that might have saved an otherwise trite short story just doesn't make any sense.Much as I admire David Baldacci, this short story is just not worth your time. The only reason that I gave it two stars instead of one is because it is still better than some of the 99 cent dreadful purchases I have made of would be authors.",This is a dud,1307923200,12,12,2,-1

"Patterson, author ofThe Craigslist Killer (A Digital Short), has turned in another uneven short story with ""19.""Misleadingly described as a medical thriller (just because a character suffers health problems doesn't mean the resulting story will appeal to readers of that genre), this story suffers from a meandering plot, unresolved details, and awkward framing.A man (nearing the end of his life?  We're just told his grey hair indicates he is older than fifty) receives a letter from an old flame.  They were actually engaged at one point, but the engagement ended.  Why?  We're told he never knew why.Okay.  Maybe those questions will be answered in the manuscript that his ex encloses.Nope.  It's a totally different story, starting at her childhood and then skipping forward to middle-age.  There's a little too much detail at the beginning (for example:  her material grandparents didn't want her parents to get married, telling her to stay away from ""Polls"" [sic]), as if Patterson initially set out to write a longer story and then lost his resolve.  So after setting the scene, we're skipped ahead decades.The plot itself, we're told, is based on a true story.  It's one of those things that you might hear of happening to a friend of a friend of a friend -- a woman smells roses if somebody in her family is about to die.  But this wasn't enough and we get two other supernatural elements that are played out in great detail and then never explained.It's less thrilling than it is sophoric.

"I admit I like free stuff. I also admit I'm not entirely rational in my thought process. For example, I happily hand over my Bouchercon and Left Coast Crime Conference fees and feel like I've won the lottery when I receive a bag filled with books. Seriously, this ends up being one of the major highlights of these conferences. So in my continued pursuit of this high, minus the conference fees, I have decided to scour Amazon for the best free short stories and books available. With that being said, let's get to the review.While ETERNITY EMBRACED packed plenty of passion into 44 pages, which should be enough to satisfy more than a few paranormal romance readers, this story still felt unsatisfying. I had trouble buying Andrea and Kaden's relationship within this tale's boundaries. A few more backstory details might have actually improved this story's momentum and made all that followed a bit more realistic.But, otherwise, it wasn't bad, as the pace and dialogue help up fairly well. And it cost me less than an hour of my time. On the other hand, I won't actively seek out more of this author's work, as I didn't exactly become more endeared toward vampires.

"Despite what the blurb would have you believe, this story does not tell of a flirtation or romance that occurred before Maxon's Selection. There is a very brief beginning in which a young French royal friend of Maxon's (what? I thought he had no friends? Whatever.) sort of throws herself at Maxon and he declines. The story immediately moves to the beginning of the Selection and into familiar territory. All we really read is Maxon's perspective of that familiar story and his interaction with the girls. The only interesting bit in my opinion was getting to see why he sent some of the girl's home during the breakfast ceremony. We also see his first interactions with Kriss, and I guess that was kinda interesting. I still can't give it three stars because I feel that the blurb was very misleading and teased the buyer with something it didn't deliver. Asking us to pay a few more dollars for basically the same exact story told through Maxon's eyes felt cheap and disrespectful.

"This is another Kindle freebie that I've hoarded away and finally got around to reading. I initially started it because of a few fellow bloggers saying that they really enjoyed it, and my hopes were high. So I feel back into the 'angel pattern' that I have and I've been hoping to break. I see great reviews, those I know enjoy it, I start reading...and disappointment. I'm starting to think I'm too picky when it comes to these things, I'm not entirely sure why me and angel books are so incompatible. I love angels and see a ton of potential both in the creature and in this story, but it seems to never come to fruition.I struggled to come up with a rating on this one, so it truly floats around a 1.5 or 2. The plot is fairly good and has a nice unique feel to it, however I'm not sure the actual execution did it justice. I like the idea of having Nephilim descendents running about, and I love the fact that they have a kind of cast structure based on ability. There are the Countenance, Noster, Levatio, Deorsum, and Celestra. They each have their defining characteristics which are pretty numerous and they kind of overlap on one another. The most ineresting of the powers are time travel and 'the knowing' which is just future sight. I had no clue that time travel was going to be involved in this and while it was kind of cool, the main character really brought it down for me. Not very much is explained in this as a whole, you do find out about the angels and you find out that they have enemies...but you never find out what exactly is going on and why.The characters in this were really frustrating and to be frank, idiots. Skyla is the main character and while she does have some wit when it comes to verbal exchanges she really seems to have trouble with really obvious things. It was just one stupid thing after another and it had me really irritated. So many things could have been avoided if she would have taken a few minutes to think about it and ask herself if it was a good idea...or maybe that's why she didn't because the answer would have always been no. Breille is the instant best friend...there is little to lead up to why these two would hit it off merely minutes after meeting  but they do. Gage and Logan are pretty interesting but they are also 'perfect'. I find Logan to be a tad smarter than Skyla but not by much, and while Gage is not as over bearing as Logan he is a bit puppy doggish. No matter what the these three do to each other, it's always forgiven and brushed over. There are also the inevitable high school enemies that Skyla obtains and that is pretty instantaneous as well. No one in this book ever takes the time to get to know anyone they just are. The whole plot involving a girl named Chloe was interesting but the one part of her story that I wanted to know more about was never even touched.Overall I wasn't really impressed with this, there was a lot of potential and it failed to deliver. I'm glad others have enjoyed this but it simply was not for me.

"If there was a documentary to be made about grass, it would probably end up being more entertaining than this book.Try as I might, I could not get myself to enjoy The Arrival... and I honestly really wanted to like it. The plot sounds like something that would actually be interesting to read. Casting a spell that ends up taking four friends to another world? Okay... that sounds like fun.But right from the start I knew there was going to be a problem as the author jumps from first to third person back to first, and from one person's internal dialog to another's verbal response. Can I have a decoder ring please? What the heck's going on here?I wouldn't normally have a problem with an author jumping around like this - plenty have pulled off this feat successfully, while clearly designating who is speaking as well as being artful in it's execution. However, this author is both clumsy and remedial in conversations as well as inarticulate in who we're supposed to be following. It takes some skill to be able to juggle four main characters without losing the reader or diluting the storyline and relationships... and apparently this author just doesn't have a knack for it. Nor does the author have a knack for scene transition, startling readers at the sudden change of time and venue. Oh, and let's not forget that there are an annoying amount of grammatical errors to enrich this already confusing word stream.I also encountered something that I thought was only a myth... spontaneous chapter endings. How this author happens to make me wince at the awkward and ill-timed endings of each chapter is beyond me. I never thought that this was even possible... it's almost like she wrote the book in one lump, then just inserted chapters at random every few thousand words.This was such a boring read, that even the author's attempt at affectionate humor between the girls had no chance of livening up the tedious storyline. I didn't laugh a single time, and that's an absolute first for me - someone who laughs at just about anything. It just wasn't funny, or fun for that matter. If anything, the author's stab at humor only made things worse, rather than giving structure to the relationships between characters.Meanwhile, us readers have to suffer through a suffocating amount of filler, as we're forced to flip through pages and pages of people putting on shoes, toasting bread, and scratching their proverbial bottoms. Completely unnecessary, monotony that neither adds to the storyline nor builds upon the characters.The fact that this book is categorized as ""Epic"" makes me laugh... the only thing epic about it, is that it was an epic waste of my time.I'll admit that I stopped smack dab in the middle of this book. I just couldn't go any further without feeling like this was self-inflicted torture. But don't worry everyone... it's still on the ole Kindle, so maybe I'll stumble onto it at a later date and feel inspired to read the rest of it. And who knows, maybe I'll change my mind and think that the latter half is awesome - but I sincerely doubt it.Oh, and on a sidenote to the author: the question ""Was this review helpful?"" is meant for the customers - not for the author to assert that she doesn't agree with the review.

"1.5 out of 5 stars. This book had such promise but then it faltered and was never able to recover. Terrible!! Zoey is a nice main character, but she is WAY too indecisive and she second-guesses herself constantly. I know she is in a kinda flux ever since her father died, but it was like she had no backbone at all. Or when she did have a backbone she used it against the wrong people. She was just lucky that Finn and Riley seemed to believe that she could do no wrong.My only other major problem with this story I had was .... how old was everyone?? I know Zoey mentions that she's 17-years-old but what about everyone else?? I mean okay say they are all the same age, that's fine. But if that's true, what is a 17-year-old, Riley, doing running a restaurant?? I mean come on!! I know his father is away, but does he really trust his son that much??So, for me, as you can tell, this story sucked! However, like I stated earlier there are a lot of people whom gave this story a great review (5 out of 5 stars at least during the time that I read it), so if you are into YA stuff this might be a story for you.

"I LOVE KA.....have read almost every one of her books (and will eventually finish them all), but this book almost stopped me from continuing with the series (fortunately I must have read At Peace at some point prior to knowing KA so when I realized, I mustered on).The problem with it was February....as a teenager, she sees one thing, doesn't say anything, doesn't allow for an explanation then proceeds to basically screw up her life with a series of bad decisions and STILL won't talk to the guy (the love of her life and EVERYONE knew it) for 22 years?  Without even asking why'd you do that?  Who does that in real life?

The story barely requires it so I really don't understand how the author could make such a big mistake.  All three books carry a 2010 copyright, suggesting they were all written in 2010, so its hard to understand how the author cold have forgotten that his characters do not face time dilation with their wormhole drive.  However, far more disappointing is the lack of a satisfying climax.

"First of all, why do authors think it's cool to have all male characters especially in a series to always be chasing after women? I decided to mention it here because I'm really tired of  reading about characters like these. This is similar to what Cat says in the story about one of Thomas's brothers, not towards Thomas. Similar also to another one of Thomas's, Dane, who sleeps around with a ton of women for ten years leaving behind his love while the woman he left behind raises his son while not being intimate with anyone. I don't know why people find it hard to believe that there are people out there that choose not to be intimate for years.  Nonetheless, there was a whole different problem with Thomas's story regarding relationships. Thomas and Cat become intimate WAY too quickly considering he's a doctor. I was actually shocked at what took place between Cat and Thomas. There is one thing to come close to intimacy and stopping in time and a whole different issue when you're in the middle of ""CHECKING A PATIENT"" and all of a sudden you're ""CHECKING OUT A PATIENT."" The romance in this was not believable at all. I skipped over a lot of it.This series reminds me of some of my favorite series by Lori Foster but in those books the characters are more likeable and perhaps more honorable than these characters.I really liked the more recent two and since I read in backwards order, perhaps the stories just got better as each one was written. However, after this one and knowing what takes place in the first one in the series, Dane, I cannot read the earlier ones that I have not read yet. This story ruined my mood for the other stories.

Well, I was right. I must have read a forgettable book by her at one time. In this story I found the characters actions, thinking etc. less than adult.

"Beautiful Demons is the second book by Sarra Cannon I have read. I didn't love the first one, The Trouble With Goodbye, but I realized I already had this book, and in some reviews for TTWG the reviewers stated they liked this series much better, so I thought I would give it a try. While I did like it better than the first book, it still wasn't amazing. I will, however, read the second book once I get through some of my library books.Beautiful Demons starts off with Harper being sent to another foster home. This is her last chance. She knows there is something different about her, but she tries to keep that secret for good reason. She accidentally started a fire when she was younger, when she gets mad things move by themselves, just things she doesn't know how to deal with. Shadowford Home is a strange place, but she is determined to make it work.Her first day of school she sees them - the cheerleaders. She had run into the star quarterback when school shopping, but once Drake found out where she lived he couldn't get away fast enough. The whole school has an obsession with the cheerleaders. They all want to be them. They are the most beautiful people in school, and date the cutest guys. Harper makes enemies pretty quick with the queen bee, but tries to stay out of trouble. She doesn't understand all the hype with them. Sure they are pretty, but so what? She also has some strange things happen to her in her first few weeks. She faints when she walks by the demon statue on her first day! She has strange dreams and people act odd. She knows something is up with the town.Harper does become friends with one of the girls she lives with, and has a huge crush on the guy who lives behind their house (the one caretakers son), Jackson. There is the instant connection with Harper and Jackson and he is trying to keep her safe. She wants to know what is going on in the town, but Jackson cannot tell her. He does his best though.Now up until this point in the book I was really enjoying it. Then one night Harper has a weird dream, is sick for a week, and when she wakes up she cannot remember what has recently happened. She can only remember a little bit of her time at Shadowford Home. The cheerleaders starts being nice to her and trying to be her friends, and Drake starts talking to her like he wants to date her. Harper, after only like 2 minutes of what is going on, is suddenly drawn into their crowd. I didn't get it. Well I got why she was, but it didn't actually seem like she was different. The writing didn't make her seem like she would suddenly want to be a cheerleader, when before she was scoffing at them. I wish it would have been more like she changed, or something made her change, to make her just forgive Drake and be all yes! This is what I want. I just didn't see it. You could still keep the moments where she thinks something is not quite right, but I didn't see her actually changing enough, or being lonely enough and wanting to fit in any way possible, for her to be trying out for the cheerleaders.Then you don't really find out what is going on in the town at all in this book. It is a pretty short book, and you don't really learn much. Hopefully some of the secrets will be revealed in the next book. It wasn't horrible, but the second half was kind of a let down. I just wish it would have been more obvious that Harper changed, instead of having her be basically the same but not. We shall see how the next book is.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland","Interesting idea, but you don't learn much in this story",1393459200,0,0,2,-1

"I haven't read the other books in the series, but there is nothing here to make me feel as though I'm missing out on much.  Puck and Ash are sworn enemies who decide to travel together and collaborate on a quest.  Puck calls Ash ""Ice Boy"" about fifteen times per page.  In my experience, a derisive nickname has more power if it isn't used constantly, but Puck doesn't seem to share that opinion.  Ash has promised a favor to a faerie queen, which involves using glamour to trick another faerie queen.If you are a fan of the faerie sub-genre, this may be just the novella for you.  For me, after reading a handful of books, I'm starting to think that I'm the one who doesn't get it.  They're beautiful, often selfish, adhere to a different moral code than humans, and tricky.  Their powers are vague - it seems like that in faerie books, they possess whatever powers are necessary to drive the story forward.",I don't think faerie books are for me,1312761600,3,3,2,-1

"I'm sure that ""Twenty-Five Cent Dinners for Families of Six"" by Juliet Corson was a great hit in its day; however, there are few recipes in this 1878 cookbook that any cook would make today. Oatmeal and peas? Sheeps' Head Stew? A pie of pork trimmings? Tripe, Curry and Rice? Suet-laden desserts? Barley water? Suet dumplings? Baked Pig's Head? No, thanks!The book does serve to provide a peek into the culinary practice -- and necessities -- of 150 years ago. This book, unlike Corson's previous cookbook, ""Fifteen Cent Dinners,"" was aimed squarely at the middle classes; even so, cooks in those days were reduced to, for example, preparing a main dish of rice, suet, flour, and molasses (made from a half-pound of uncooked rice and a quarter pound of suet) to feed themselves, a husband, and four children. A large fish had to be stretched into two meals for a hungry family of six. Many of the recipes are stews, broths, and soups made from neckbones. One main dish, a meat brewis -- nothing more than a stale loaf of bread soaked in hot broth and then served -- is lauded as ""satisfactory, nutritious and economical; enough for a hearty meal costing not more than five cents."" If the middle class lived like this, what was life like for the 80 percent that were working class or poorer?Corson's notions of nutrition -- heavy on fats and carbohydrates -- are a world away from ours in most aspects. Yes, Corson gives a nod to fresh vegetables, but few of the recipes feature any and there's no separate category for them as there is for meats, legumes, soups, and desserts. Corson decries roasting and baking -- what we consider the best way to prepare meat -- as an affront to frugality. You can imagine Corson shuddering at such wanton prodigality when she writes: ""The first [roasting] is the most extravagant way of cooking meat, as it wastes nearly one third of its substance in drippings and steam; the second [baking] also is very wasteful, unless the meat is surrounded with vegetables, or covered with a flour paste."" Corson preferred ""[b]oiling food slowly, or stewing it gently, [which] saves all its goodness."" I can't imagine Americans today relishing meats boiled for four to six hours. She also ensures that, in her recipes, ""very little fat is wasted."" Corson loves fatty gravy and ""seasoned suet"" -- whatever that is. Corson also can't resist make a pitch for temperance and against beer. And a glance through the cookbook shows that 19th century women spent HOURS cooking most days. ""Hasty"" pudding takes an hour, to give you an idea of how long.Don't get me wrong: A few of the recipes do still hold up. Corson, ever frugal, lists recipes (""receipts"" in her parlance) for making your own lemon and orange flavoring, vanilla extract, and tarragon vinegar. The rice pudding, bread pudding, fruit dumplings (which one would make with pie crust rather than a suety crust), stewed pears, Strawberry Drops, and most of the desserts look delicious. The Pork Pie, if pork chunks were substituted for pork trimmings, looks appetizing. The Roast Pork and Potatoes (reserved for Sunday) would pass muster today if it weren't cooked for two hours and doused with water.Still, this isn'tJOY OF COOKING, which has held up so well: It's more history text than cookbook.",useful only for its historical value,1342310400,13,13,2,-1

"The whole of the tale is a MC telling about a place from college that saw several disappearances and one almost disappearance.  He tells his story due to memories evoked when he gets an invite (or notification) related to reunion.The story, while well told for the most part (not a ton of errors), was rather monotone in nature.  It was fully a tell book with mere snippets of dialogue for showing things. And the telling did not grip, did not hook, did not cause huge interest along the lines of ""I just gotta see what happens next.""  It felt flat affect and, thus, produced little effect in this reader.The premise was interesting and could have driven many ways and involved reader emotion on many levels - had there been ANY type emotion (beyond apathy) conveyed.  One does not even feel dire circumstances related to the near disappearance as it was not conveyed with any emotion by narrator.  There was encounter and dude got away and I did not (at any time) think, ""whew, that was close one, "" or ""get outta there buddy, you in danger! "" - just read flat to this reader.The ending was fitting related to the whole of the tale - evoked no response in this reader - other than ""over.""  It was basically a non ending end given genre.

"Over the decades, many forests have been clear cut and the wood pressed into pulp to make paper for the sole purpose of publishing books that tell you how to lose weight. How many weight loss books do you really have to read to get it through your head to eat less and exercise more, and eat healthy stuff? Well, apparently one more.So here we have a short, very short Kindle book that is using electricity, probably generated by dirty coal, contributing to global warming, so that people can read yet another book that explains how to lose weight, which of course, is to not eat so much and get some regular exercise.This book suggests basically a lot of exercises directed at the stomach, and so on.It has some eating tips, but suggests no specific belly-fat buring foods, although warns against some. For example, the author admonishes importantly: ""Sugar is bad news!"" He says, ""sugar turns directly into fat?"" Holy moly! This will certainly come as a revelation to millions!Here is another stunning revelation in this book: ""All the energy in your body is provided by the protein, fat and carbohydrates that you eat."" Wow! You mean human beings cannot absorb energy directly by taking in cosmic rays, or use sunlight and chlorophyll to manufacture nourishment?But, weight loss books sell and sell. Publishers know that. Writers know that. So they keep churning them out, and people keep buying them, seeking that ever elusive Holy Grail: Losing Weight. The way to do that, of course, it to eat less and exercise more.

"Warning: This review contains spoilers. I just finished this book. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a Christian conservative. As such, I have a particular bias against books and works of fiction that attack Christians and conservatives. The author basically boils down the cause of all ills leading to his fictional civil war as non-catholic Christian social conservatives. He presents the premise that because Christian evangelicals refused to sit down, shut up, and let the slaughter of innocence continue, it caused a civil war. Because this same group refused to condone gay marriage, it caused a civil war. Because conservatives refused to allow the Federal government to grow into the single authority in the country, it caused a civil war. He lays all the blame for societies ills at the feet of those who believe in living their lives according to God's word, who also believe that the constitution and the Bill of Rights should apply to the Federal Government. The narrator, due to his many years of reflection, comes to understand that the beliefs he once held, contributed to the war. A reformed Christian and Conservative...who better to tell the story, right?I will say that the story is well written, in that it flows well. How the narrator came to be telling his story is an interesting premise. Beyond that, it's really a waste of time. At least it's cheap entertainment.",Interesting despite it's bias,1277078400,18,18,2,-1

"I downloaded this because I was interested in the first book that is soon to be released. It sounds interesting and has a lot of the elements I enjoy: magic, mythology incorporation, and boarding schools (blame harry potter). However I was seriously disappointed in this. First off I felt that it should have been longer, it only took 30 minutes max for me to get through this. Somethings were extremely rushed and I still didn't care when it was over. I think this would have been a lot better if it had been fleshed out some more. The writing is...okay at best, there were times when I literally grunted at things that irritated me because it was so frequent. For instances there is a lot of repetition in either wording or phrasing, and after a certain point it becomes very irritating and somewhat elementary. I don't like the main character and none of the conversations felt real, it was almost like watching one of those teenage shows where you can obviously tell it's scripted. It is however an interesting concept that I'm willing to look into when it finally comes out because I do want to know the full premise.

I actually flipped the page when I got to the end, expecting the story to go on (and no, I did not expect a novel, but maybe a twist or at least some kind of resolution). When it didn't, I felt cheated. The set up was great, the characters artfully drawn, and the story itself had great potential. But from where I sit, it seems Lippman abandoned the potential and just stopped writing, rather than going to the effort of finishing the story in a satisfying way. The sad thing is, her publishers probably released this short as enticement to buy THE BABYSITTER'S CODE. I fear it will have the opposite effect.",Disappointing,1237420800,4,4,2,-1

"I enjoyed Astra Synchronicity, BUT...  The reason for the low rating I have given the book is primarily due to the fact Synchronicity is but the first installment in a larger story and does not stand on its own well.  More than that, the second book, Astra The Reckoning is an unbridled piece of garbage.  The main characters all start acting in ways contrary to their character and in doing so become loathsome.  I don't know about you, but I can't keep reading when the protagonists start acting in ways that show they are really just poor excuses for human beings.  If you invest your time in this series you will be disappointed.  Given my extreme disappointment with book 2, some of the failings in book 1 that I put up with now stick in my craw.  Namely, you can also look forward to such amateur hour goodies like the overuse and continued misuse of the word facade, and a protagonist with telekinetic powers who is too stupid to realize that he can win any fight by simply lifting his opponent off the ground and holding him there (or an author to stupid to think of that and at least address it).",don't get sucked into this trilogy; you will be disappointed,1336780800,10,10,1,-1

"ok, so I liked the overall story and the direction the series is taking but I have a few issues with this installment. First of all, I don't mind my romances having some angst... but I like to part of the angst, not looking in from a totally different perspective. It should draw you in and make you feel it rather than being an all knowing observer fored to do nothing but alternate between rolling you eyes, growling, and yelling at your e-reader.For example, Bryn managed to misinterpret EVERYTHING! I get that she has severe self esteem issues (for no apparent reason so far in the story) but I mentally challenged monkey would not be as oblivious as she is.

I don't understand why though, I mean in the first book it was the same way but then all of the sudden John calls Bryn a whore (seemed so out of place when all of the characters say ""darn"").

"This is a must-read only for die-hard Balogh fans and epilogue lovers.  Those who have a low threshold for boredom and honest-to-gosh wholesomeness, stay away.  We're supplied with a few chapters cut from the first two MISTRESS books, about Jocelyn and Ferdinand, and by reading them, we see why the editors suggested cutting them in the first place, but for a true Balogh fan they could be an interesting read.  Then we get an epilogue to all 3 MISTRESS books, including the most recent THE SECRET MISTRESS.  It takes place maybe 5 years after Ferdinand and Viola's wedding. (They're the last couple to marry.)  Here you get yourself up to date on how many children everyone has, how happy they all are and how wholesome their lives are.  It's like a Hallmark card and many fans will like it.But for me, this should not have cost even 99 cents.

While Jade confronts an violent man in a car, Mac is too drunk to assist.  Jade justifiably kills the man and Mac is booted from the force.  Five years later, their roles are reversed and she is Mac's training officer.  Inthe mean time,someone is sending her boxes of dead flowers, trashing her house and stalking her. Her supervising officer hates her and is hotforMac.  Mac meanwhile is hot for Jade.  turns out that Jade's sonis actually Mac's also, theresult of a one night stand that was the best ight of her life.  Unfortuantely,he has no recollection of it. The plot drags in Jade's alcoholic father and fiance and a cross dressing commander.  Of course, it all ends happily.This book is awful.  The plot is ridiculous the characters cardboard.  It veers from police procedural to very,very bad romance novel.  For instance, Jade's supervising officer is a proceduralnit picker except when it applies to her. She ignores Jade's complaints about being stalked and flagrantly sexually harasses Mac. Jade is supposedly so intelligent she falls into bed with someone too drunk to know what is going on.  Her apartment isburglarized and her child threatened but she doesn't call the police. The dialogue is trite, the pace glacial and the prose preachy and boring.  LA police officers should be offended.

This book would have fared much better after rigorous editing sessions, but as it is, it reads like an amateur try at the big-bad-world of writing. The grammatical mistakes are astounding, the lack of commas, frightening. If I had a dollar for every adverb in this book...I wish, as an aspiring author, I could recommend this book.

"I've read longer works by Ms. James, and found them unmemorable.  Novels take more skill than might appear--developing characters the reader can like or dislike, or in some way find interesting enough to continue turning the page. As I recall, she doesn't particularly excell in the long form. I gave this work a try, hopinng Eloisa James's forte might be in the shorter work.  While it is difficult to develop characters much in the time and space contraints of the novella, one would hope for interesting characters, at least.  Ms. James has fallen to the temptation of crafting paper doll characters: all rather shallow and incredible extremes.  The husband is rough and evil, but not entirely so.  His successor is suave and courteous, but not particularly so.  The protagonist (there are actually two and a half) is a man who apparently has grown and changed very little from boy to man, yet we are supposed to root for him.

If the book was supposed to be about a developing relationship between Thomas and Tria, then there was very little emotion to sustain it and because nothing actually happens in these books, there is no redeeming moment in them either.

"I really did. The story premise is good and I like the split narrative between 1912 and 2012. The technology the author introduces stretches credulity a bit, but I can live with that just fine; the book is fiction trending toward science fiction after all.All of the good ideas are wiped away by one key failing as far as I can tell: no editor. Or, if an editor was used that person was, well, not very good. A good editor could have easily cut 20,000 or more words out of the book and it would have been much better for it. An editor would, I hope, have caught a mistake like this from a scene where characters in 1912 are discussing armaments available to them on the Titanic:""I want one of those!"" probably have had some Lee Enfield MKIII Short Rifles on board for close confines of ship. It was in .303 British caliber a pretty potent round up to 300 yards. You can probably google those weapons if you need more particulars.""If I thought it would do any good other than getting more men killed than these disgusting creatures"", Murdoch replied, ""I'd break into the Vickers machine guns on board.""The author's note to himself to do a little more research on SMLE rifles finds its way into the final text.There are many other examples similar to this one throughout the book. Not author notes appearing, but problems that never would have been had a good editor been used.The author came up with what I think was a very good idea for a story with a different take on the Titanic disaster and it could have been epic.

There is even a Ms. Brill in the book.But, much worse, the author seems oblivious of the reason people crave to read this type of book: to confirm that Lizzy and Darcy are happy.While there is no discord between them, the poor couple spends all their time dealing with family crises requiring separations or enduring annoyances. Their relationship doesn't evolve, it merely endures and survives all the stresses. This is reassuring, but hardly pleasant. Poor Georgiana is not spared but, at least, she gets a happy ending after all her tribulations. The author's idea of a satisfying conclusion to the story for Lizzy and Darcy is not one I found the slightest bit pleasing. -SPOILER AHEAD IN NEXT PARAGRAPH--As a matter of fact, I can think of nothing I like less than having a child other than their own become heir to Pemberley.

"These short stories need a lot more work as to realism and characterization.Too many of the stories rely on the surprise or ""twist"" of the story serving as a substitute for drawing realistic characters and too many details just didn't ring true.  It didn't ring true that a group of Vietnam veterans would gather regularly in the manner described to relive events (it was also unclear to me how old they were supposed to be - half of them were dead and the rest were painted as elderly, but they were foot soldiers in Vietnam in the 1970s, making them around the age of my step-father - hardly old men.  Men in their 60s can usually sit still without having to fidget through arthritis pains).  The assassin characters in another story didn't ring true either and their unnecessarily convoluted scheme was obviously created by a fiction writer.The editing was very poor.  Here is a sample sentence from a story:  ""Tyler finally knew freedom, his conciseness finally allowed to across the universe.""  While the average reader can probably figure out what is meant by that sentence, why should we have to?  Reading shouldn't be a job of assembling a sentence from what we think the author might mean.The story with the most potential was the one with a dentist as a main character.  I was not surprised to see that the author is a dentist, given that the story was more grounded in realistic detail than any other.  Within writing what he knows, he was able to create a narrator more believable than any of his others and a story - while still leaving something to be desired in terms of characterization and plot - that was most satisfying to me as a reader.",So-so,1309392000,3,3,2,-1

I didn't even had time to really connect to the characters. And I was annoyed by how easily they both got angry when things didn't go how they wanted.

"I got 5 books from this series when they were free for the kindle. I will not be buying any more. I've read 5 books and while I enjoyed the first 2, they are fast going down hill. The plot is repetitive; save Maria, find shelter, and no progress is ever made. The characters keep having the same arguments and making the same bad decisions again and again. The sentence structure is awful with words missing or misplaced as well as lots of wrong word choices (passed instead of past, they're instead of their). It is also confusing trying to figure out which book goes first. Chronologically speaking, it seems like ""Villains of the Apocalypse"" should be first. It appears to follow the scientists as they are creating the OZ ""zombie"" virus. The Secret Journal has a part 1 and 2 while the other books are numbered 1 through 4. Maybe the author wrote a prequel and found out they were addictive and just kept writing one more prequel? It doesn't help when most of the books start with a scene and then go back to tell you how they got in this sticky situation.The description on Amazon is a bit vague. Here's another one.Three scientists have developed a virus intended for use as a weapon. They are testing it on various groups that no one should really miss (refugees, terrorists and people smugglers for example). There is a containment breach in the Australian Outback and in a short period of time, the country is overrun with zombies. A media blackout meant to control panic and prevent the story from getting out also keeps most of the world ignorant of the disaster. Most of the story is told from Rebecca's point of view, she is an average 16 yr old girl. Other main characters are: Maria Marsh (another teen with an immunity to the virus), Jack (Maria's boyfriend), Kim (Jack's older sister and a police officer in Sydney) and Kenji Yoshido (Rebecca's 19 yr old boyfriend and a marine sniper). The entire focus of the series is getting Maria Marsh out of Australia to the doctors who will hopefully create a cure.There is a lot of running around Syndey and the Outback trying to escape monsters, looking for transportation, shelter, food and water. You also have religious fanatics sacrificing women and children to the zombies, mutant animals, giant zombies, and rogue nanobots that are animating machinery. I almost forgot, Kenji can see and talk to dead people.","Confusing, badly edited and repetitive",1377475200,2,2,2,-1

"This installment in the Bitten series picks up where Ben's mate, Ally, a human, has been kidnapped by his vampire fiance (I saw that one coming a mile away.). Moira has no intention of letting this morphing vampire keep Ben. She has been conspiring for hundreds of years for this marriage, and nothing is going to stand in her way. She loves Ben (or thinks she does). Her behavior is both juvenile and evil. Moira has no intention of letting her hostages go. (Yes, I said hostages. Now both of Ally's best friends have been kidnapped to insure her good behavior. Saw that one coming, too.)Ben refuses to believe that Moira has had anything to do with Ally's disappearance, after all, she's hunting for her true mate also. His friend, Gabe, suspects the truth, and sets out to find it. Moira's family is known to be power hungry and cruel, although no one on the Council has caught them doing anything illegal. Gabe's family was destroyed by them when information was manufactured against them. Now they only have about thirty percent of what they once had, and Moira's family took most of their magical relics, stating they had been stolen from them.Ben finally gets suspicious! (Took him almost all of the story to get there!) Give me a break. This man is supposed to be worried sick over his mate's kidnapping, and doesn't suspect the one person who has the most to gain? He's supposed to be hundreds of years old, and he hasn't learned that people lie to get what they want?This second 'novella' is really another couple of chapters in 'Bitten' saga , and like the first, it ended in another(!) cliffhanger. This series reads like a serial novel, and second one cannot be read as a stand alone, and make any sense. Call me a glutton for punishment, but I was hoping 'Stolen' was better. There was a little more action, but the same problems exist in this one as they do in the first. To wit: grammatical errors, misspellings, tense errors, juvenile dialogue, and repeated phrases. I had sincerely hoped I would be more pleased with 'Stolen', but I wasn't. I do not like writing critical reviews, but I think they are important when merited. In this particular case, I feel like there weren't as many critical reviews of 'Stolen', because many chose not to read it after having read 'Bitten'. I cannot, in all honesty, provide a good recommendation, but good luck to those who still want to try it.",Call me a glutton for punishment...,1315872000,1,1,2,-1

"Greg is a likeable young man who becomes concerned when his sister disappears after a date with a tall, dark stranger.  While searching her apartment, he learns she participated in a dinner club for singles.  He decides to conduct his own investigation into her disappearance.  While at one of the dinner soirees he meets Megan, one of the more reluctant participants.  She has been dragged there by her femme fatale friend Brenda.  Brenda also goes missing leading Greg and Megan to join forces to locate and unmask the serial killer.Although the plot sounds promising, the execution is awful.  With the exception of Greg, all the charactes are one dimensional and immensely unlikeable.  I can certainly understand why none of them have dates.  The writing is clumsy, the red herrings painfully obvious and quite frankly, by chapter two, I just didn't care.  Greg and Megan's investigation consists of swilling wine and tramping through the outback, alienating the police and breaking laws, all done without wit or suspense.The author does no favors to those suffering from mental illness, making a character with bipolar disorder seem like a real freak.

"I won a copy of this book in Elle Casey's January Anniversary Indie Book Giveaway. This had a lot going for it, and in the beginning I liked it a lot - promising characters in Sophie and her friends, some nice gothic mystery trappings - but as it went on it was rather disappointing. There is a lot of complex, original supernatural mythology, but it didn't have nearly enough world-building. It was all crammed into one book at a weird kind of fast pace - it almost felt like watching a movie on Fast-Forward! Also, I could never get a real handle on who Sophie was as a person. Her characterization was kind of inconsistent, which was fine for other characters whose motivations remain mysterious to help drive the plot, but mostly just confusing in the lead POV. I also had issue with the grammar throughout - mostly with commas, or lack thereof.

As some have already mentioned the story started off great and I liked how the author was developing the characters, but the turning point for me, almost like a light switch was put on was when... SPOILER ALERT? Natalie gets really drunk while Brandon attempts to propose to her at the restaurant. She belittles him on her drunken state and tells him that her mother doesn't even know about him, that she doesn't think they will work etc etc. What man wouldn't leave at that? I disliked the character instantly, but I kept reading because I was already in. Natalie is selfish (she's involve with Anthony for a year, stringing him along, why? out of her insecurity. Brandon was patient and chasing after her throughout the book. Natalie is constantly second guessing her love for Brandon, to the point I think she doesn't really love him. She's also weak. When her mother and soon to be mother-in-law are arguing instead of jumping in and stopping the whole thing, she's in her own world and passes out. At one point, I think her best friend hand to speak for her. I was so over it at this point and had to skip some pages when she once again was having doubts on marrying Brandon. On her wedding day. Yes, while Brandon is at the altar, she's thinking about ditching him and having a panic attack. Again someone had to save her in this case Scotty to talk some sense to her.

"OK so I read her entire series so far and this is the one that was a waste of my money.  I feel they split this into two different books as a money maker and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  All the author could have done was to add a few extra chapters to Part I to include a wedding and deal with the man who took her virginity and it would have been great leaving it like that. Instead they came up with a part 2 that went on and on and on.  I am a fan of the menage etc.... but also like a storyline to keep things interesting.  Everyother page had sexual encounters which got old. I kept thinking how unrealistic this was and how this poor girl would be wheelchair bound with all the action she was getting. Also, unless there will be sequels....certain characters didn't even have to be in the book. Example:  Elijah (Eli's father) and his new love the realtor....Ace and his new fling.

"After reading this book, I'm still not sure whether I liked it or hated it overall.  I liked some parts and hated other parts.  It was better than the first book in some ways, but worse in different ways.The story was certainly entertaining, and kept me turning pages.  I really did want to know what happened next.  So, in that sense, the book is a success in its own right, and a worthy successor to book one.However,  this book is sold as a middle grade book, but I find it entirely inappropriate for the average middle grade kid.  It might be okay for those on the older end of the spectrum, depending on the individual's personality and such.  I would definitely not want MY kid reading this.(That is particularly sad, because the first book was well-suited for the middle grade reader.)The book begins well enough, with Flea and his foster mother now living in a new town.  If you read the first book, you know that much was expected.  To my pleasant surprise, Flea has finally found a bully-free zone.  His life is pretty good; he's even making friends.  Of course he misses the North Pole, but he's finally found a good school in the normal human world.  Not bad.Then, the book angered me for the first time.  For no apparent reason whatsoever, we sit in on one of Flea's science classes, where the teacher lectures the class about how we now know that global warming is false.  She claims this is ""proven"" and her reasoning seems to be that there is a freak snowstorm.  Aside from the terrible science of claiming that one freak snowstorm somehow ""proves"" anything at all, the thing that bothered me was that a SCIENCE TEACHER was spouting this nonsense to a class of children.  At first, though, I thought that this was obviously some major plot point - a stupid plot point, but clearly important.  I was wrong.  It isn't.  It is just some throwaway garbage.  We never revisit this concept again.  Nor do we ever go back to the teacher and somehow weave this into her as a person (which would make it a character point).  Now, you might suggest that putting this scene in helps play up the oddness of the weather and how people are struggling to understand it, but I don't think so.  It struck me as nothing more than a pitiful attempt at political brainwashing.  In fact, the scene was entirely gratuitous.(If any readers are reaching for a dictionary, gratuitous means unnecessary.)While I am on the subject of things that annoyed me, I have to mention that the grammar is terrible.  The author claims that this is a revised version where the grammar has been cleaned up.  If that is true, then I wince to imagine what the original must have looked like.  The most persistent and annoying grammar issue was the author's apparent hatred of ""a"" and ""an"" throughout the text.  He either drops the indefinite article completely, or replaces it with the definite article (""the"").  This is especially annoying in wrongly-worded phrases like ""all of the sudden"" and ""in the matter of minutes"" (both phrases he overuses to the point where you could make a drinking game out of finding them).Also, another issue was stupid inconsistencies.  Is Scruffy a male or a female?  If you go by the pronouns, Scruffy must like getting gender changes often.  We also have name inconsistencies, where someone is doing something and then some other name will continue the action.  As a result, you are wondering whether the characters are randomly name swapping or whether you missed some crucial bit where two characters actually switched places or something.So, anyway, we get to the North Pole, and the book annoys me again.  Don't worry, I won't spoil any major plot points here.  So, Scruffy invites Flea to come visit the stable anytime.  Then, just a few short pages later, Flea is bored and has nothing to do because all his elf friends are hibernating.  So, you'd think he would pop in and visit Scruffy, right?  Nope.  He chooses to remain bored instead.  He also doesn't explore the rest of the North Pole village.  He has a reason for avoiding the Ice Bank (fear of what could happen to him if he gets too close), and of course he hasn't earned entrance to the Toy Factory yet, but the rest of the North Pole is wide open and much of it unexplored.  This is why Flea sits around with nothing to do for days.  But then, later, when things get busy (he's back in school and his elf friends are awake), THEN Flea decides to find some time to visit Scruffy.  Go figure.And, of course, we also invoke the maxim that Flea's questions must remain unanswered.  We're used to Niko refusing to answer Flea's questions; we all know he never has time for anything but expounding on how he doesn't have time for anything.  But, when Flea confronts Santa with a direct question, you'd think a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" would be in Santa's capabilities.  (A ""maybe"" or ""I don't know"" might have sufficed, if that were actually the answer.)Fair warning: the ending is grisly.  Many readers will be very upset by it, especially the younger ones.I also believe that many younger ones will be very upset about how the author handles Rudolph.  In fact, I'm older, and I was, well, let's just say not pleased.Some of the smarter younger ones will pick up on the fact that Santa is a liar, too.  I don't think you can do anything worse to the Christmas legends than turn Santa into a bald-faced liar.  It's subtle and most kids probably won't realize it, but there will be those that do.  I imagine most young kids won't appreciate it.On the plus side, this book does a better job of explaining the motivations of the secondary characters than the first book did.  I spent less time shaking my head and wondering why someone would do this or that thing.  This area could still use some improvement, but it is leaps and bounds better than the first book.This author's ability to keep me hooked and turning pages despite not really liking many of the places we were going on the journey is truly remarkable.  I have to give him kudos for his storytelling talent.  I can find no fault with his execution.The problems all lie within the content itself.There is currently a fad for twisting classic and traditional tales and icons.  This book caters nicely to that crowd.  Unfortunately, that fad is primarily an adult phenomenon, and this is marketed as a middle grade book.  As I said at the beginning, I think this book is not appropriate for a middle grade audience.",Good and Bad,1379808000,0,0,2,-1

"Stuff happens at the start of the book and stuff happens a few chapters before the end, but the rest has as much action or interest as paint drying.  Maybe if the story had been shortened up considerably, it would have been better.  The scenes are all drawn out until the story has no momentum.  I can see why the heroine asks the hero if he is gay.  He keeps tentatively coming on to her and then backing off and acting like he never showed any interest in between.  I like plenty of romantic tension that builds quite a bit before the first kiss even, but it has to be tension, not boredom.  I liked the female main character, but the guy character seemed dull.  I couldn't maintain interest in his heartburn about his last serious girlfriend. Then after the climax of the story, there's this get together of all the couples from the other books in the series that went on way too long.  This author needs to work on plotting and characterization I think. It  would have been better if there was more detail about the two characters' backstories.  At least this story was only 99 cents.

"I'm not one to give two stars, but I have good reason with this book. First, let's start with the positives- The main characters were well developed and likable. The story line was interested, though at first I was sure I was reading a book I'd already read (similar beginnings to a few other romances). Those were the redeeming qualities. Now on to the negative. There was not a lot of sexual tension. The author doesn't seem passionate when writing scenes between the two characters. There's no steam, no heart pounding will he or won't he. The scene where the two finally get together is so late in the book it could have been passed over completely. The scene itself completely lacks the passion these two characters were capable of. So deflated of a scene I was shocked.

"The premise for this story was good, a bunch of teenagers suddenly find out that they have super powers and set out to discover the who, how and why? Simple enough right?Apparently, not so much. This reads like a technical manual and started off rather abruptly. The writer imbued no nuance or colour to the story or the characters, there was no metaphor, allegory, just nothing, hell I would have been content with a simile. Everything was laid out for the reader. Sam did this this and this, then he did that. Really? No emotions jumped off the pages at me and so I couldn't connect with the characters because they were so very flat, the dialogue was ridiculous as well. The characters speak and interspersed between their lines we get running commentary of the one sided conversation, nay commentary, in Sam's head, which reads much the same way the rest of the book does. An example would be ""I can't believe Leesha hasn't screwed her life up, her mom's a total deadbeat. It's good she has her grandparents to depend on when she needs it."" Hmmm, why not ""Sam marveled that with a deadbeat like Tina for a mom, Leesha had been able to avoid a similar fate, perhaps having grandparents that cared enough to be in her corner when needed had been her saving grace."" And not as mind commentary. Just sayin', if we're inside his head shouldn't we be privy to his emotions rather than just the words swirling around in there?It's OK to have interesting ideas, a lot of people do, however having an interesting idea doesn't mean you have the ability or skill to translate it into an interesting story. And this was not an interesting story in the least, simply put, it just wasn't very creative beyond the idea of a bunch of super powered kids, the writing wasn't bad, just incredibly uninspired. I had a difficult time finishing it because I lost interest pretty quickly, I almost felt as if I were reading one of the dry Anthropology journal articles that I have to read throughout the semester and to be honest, I would rather have been reading one of those instead, at least they impart knowledge heretofore unknown to me. The only reason that I finished is because I can't not finish a book that I've started. So, I won't be reading the rest of this series as I'm pretty sure that it'll be more of the same and school doesn't start for another month so I have no intention of reading anything that reads like a journal article.

"The NYT is way over-rated. Just a few examples. On their first page, they talked about saving the nation's energy by painting roofs white. Any white paint? No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article. My tone was reserved and systematic. The subject was the blocking of medical innovation by the medical bureaucracy and government. (FDA) GUESS WHAT? tHE COMMENT WAS ERASED. They evidently censor comments they don't agree with, or that may offend their advertisers. Is this the kind of society you want? You may not agree with me, but do you want to shut up those you  disagree with? Hint: You could be next.So my objections to the NYT are ethical and moral.

"This was a craaaazy mismash.  Could not figure out what the author's point was?  World Peace?  Seriously, there's a fairly long scientific discussion of the importance of bees and polination and world devestation without them (which is cool, I follow bee health, but seemed totally forced and out of context) and a mysterious jade statue that - like a butterfly's wings flapping will make a typhoon, regulates the bees. But there's also Costa Rican jail, armed mercenaries, falls down jungle cliffs, nights spent out in the jungle by someone who would be more likely to be on the ""Real Housewives"" series - and a jarring disconnect as a love story rekindles and grows, and a character finds ""herself.""  It was kind of fun until the lectures and the navel gazing revelations and the absolute crazy disconnect of glossing over what started it all.  That was odd and really took away from the book, as did the focus on bees when I'd so much rather have been reading about the aromatherapy healing cures found in the rainforest - odd that that was given very little importance compared with the ""man's"" work!  Would have been dissapointed if it hadn't been free.  I was also equally confused about the message sent to women by the author, as the heroine found her personal power she also found a lot more self blame and a lot less justifiable blame.

I mean, come on, who says being a tomboy means you can't be a real woman, which is what is intimated in this novel. Or that women have certain work they should be doing and men have other work and neither the twain shall meet? She actually used the term woman's work! What is with the whole virtue thing also? I men, if my father asked me if I had been violated at age 24, I would have told him to mind his own business. She's been engaged twice but is still has not been violated? Who says that?

There are secondary characters that are stuck in just to explain the plot but the connections are never made between them and the main characters.

I felt awful for Jackson's wife, even though she wasn't really likeable as a character. The absence of any guilt on Lucy's or Jackson's part was absurd.

"I'm not sure what I expected from this book.  This was one of my first kindle downloads.  Honestly, it was on the top 100 free books at the so I snagged it despite the lack luster reviews.  As I said, thankfully it's short.So what's it about?  Well I suppose it's a supernatural thriller.  Megan had a stalker named Damon at one time..apparently Damon, or whoever he really is, can take the faces off of people after killing them.  Damon was run off months ago by two of Megan's friends but she's been receiving phone calls and her apartment seems to have been disturbed recently.  She thinks it could be him but the friends who originally ran him off say it can't possibly be.Enter, Graham..the handsome stranger...he seems to be admiring her where she works and her friend Laurel sets up a chance meeting.  The attraction is instant and Megan, Graham and two of her friends, Laurel and Craig end up all going to a cabin Graham has in the woods...then things go horribly awry.I do admit that the twist was one I didn't see coming.  Thus the 2 star review.  The writing was on the wall though so it wasn't as if the rug was pulled out from me by the author, so that much was good.  It was the execution of the story that I didn't much care for..the characters in particular...I felt them to be mostly boorish and flat.  I also mention another pet peeve: the overuse of the exclamation point..when every piece of dialogue ends in! It sort of dilutes the effect of when they're really supposed to be shocked! Or surprised! Or angry! Know what I mean?!In addition, I didn't find the book to be very thrilling or scary.

"Several aspects of ""Another Chance"" led to my giving it 2 stars. First, the plot is weak and unbelievable. Second, the main character, who is a grown woman, is immature. Her hormones must have been in overdrive because she was always crying. Third, other secondary adult female characters act like a bunch of teenagers. In fact, none of the characters were well-rounded. I don't read romance often--unless it is Karen Kingsbury. However, I decided to purchase this romance since it is listed as a Christian romance. I was extremely disappointed and had to force myself to finish it because I wanted to write a review. I am glad I only paid .99 for the ebook.

"I must admit I am baffled.  I was bored and surfing for a book, saw the rave reviews for this one and thought, well, I'll try it.  So I downloaded the sample, got comfy in my favorite reading spot, and was riveted.  Not because the book was good--it isn't; it is the equivalent of a digital train wreck.  I kept reading, telling myself it had to get better since so many other people loved it.  Right?Oh, so, SO wrong.A reviewer for another book wrote that readers won't have a problem with writing if they just don't expect too much from the writing.  So...the secret to enjoying what we read isn't the author's skill or craft, it's lowered expectations?  Gotcha.Please, do read this book if you don't expect characters, especially the protag, to be developed.  Or sympathetic.  Please read this if you have a loose definition of what makes a hero.  Please read this if you like your female lead to be cursed with Ridiculously Tragic Back Story Syndrome with a dash of Too Stupid to Love disorder.  Please read this if you don't expect too much from a plot:  Abusive, controlling father who is easily fooled by abused daughter who sleeps under her bed to avoid being raped or molested by daddy's drunk friends instead of acting like the grown woman she allegedly is and moving out of unsafe place but who instead goes off to work AND college so she can support his drinking habit yet arranges to spend time with a stranger who sounds crazy but, sheesh, there's just something about him...the English teacher in me demands that I go back and fix that stinker of a sentence, but I won't.  Why, you ask?  Because if you still want to read this book, you'd be better off to just lower your expectations now and get used to such drek.Where have all the editors gone?  Is there anyone left who will proofread material and give constructive advice as to how to fix BAD writing so that we readers no longer need to lower our expectations in order to enjoy what we read?  Is there anybody with reasonable expectations who will say, ""Gee, Dear Author, if people are going to be willing to spend their hard-earned money on your work, the very least you can do is work hard at your craft to earn their money.""Sadly, in this case, the negative reviews are the most accurate.  I am all for trying new authors, but I don't know how many times I have wasted space on my Kindle for this type of bad writing.  From now on I won't bother reading the reviews--they're meaningless, and I won't try any cheap-y bargains in the hopes of discovering a new favorite.

"I recently read Dandelions in the Garden by Charlie Courtland, and became an instant fan of her storytelling. So, naturally I was very much looking forward to reading the book's sequel, The Hidden Will of the Dragon. Unfortunately, I was barely two chapters in when I realized this novel would be nothing like the first and was greatly disappointed as I continued to read.The main characters from Dandelions in the Garden, had stopped evolving with the ending of that book and instead digressed into hollow players in this drawn out and lackluster novel. The way the story was told had changed and by doing so, lost all appeal for me. There were also far too many errors throughout this book for me to over look. I had noticed some in the previous story but didn't pay much attention to them since the story itself provided a satisfying read, but Hidden Will of the Dragon was completely riddled with them! I understand this falls partly on the editor, or lack of one if that's the case, but either way it should have been picked through and polished before publishing.Hidden Will picks up where Dandelions left off but doesn't flow along with the original story quite right. I had grown fond of Amara, Elizabeth's lady in waiting, admiring her strong will and ability to keep her head when everything around her was falling to pieces. I had enjoyed reading about her romances and her troubles, about her marriage and the strong bond she and her husband had between them. In this book, there isn't a bit of that. Amara is weak, needy and someone I ended up not being able to stand. And then there's Elizabeth, who I no longer sympathized with and just like with Amara, couldn't tolerate. She was out of her mind, annoyingly self centered and her actions were pointless.I feel absolutely awful having to leave this review! I enjoyed the first book and had assumed the second would be an accurate follow up but it fell flat, very flat. The story was there, and could have been saved and written in a way where the reader still felt attached to the characters they had connected with before, instead of having to read far too many pages without being able to absorb it. I'm sure there are many readers out there who enjoyed this book, and I'm glad that they did!

"I bought this novel back in 2012, so when I finally got the chance to read it, I was more than thrilled, but then I was let down immensely. The novel begins with two girls, Beckett Smith and Chloe Baker, at the Aurora Bridge, talking about an event that has taken place before the novel started. Honestly, I think I would've enjoyed this novel a lot more if it was told from both Beckett and Chloe's point-of-view, but it wasn't. It was only told from Beckett's point-of-view. Also, I didn't really connect with any of the characters. I'm not sure if this was because of the characters or the way the story was told. Overall, I wasn't really a fan of this novel, however, I do think that this novel could help a lot of young people who is struggling with being accepted and is considering suicide...this novel teaches you that there is never a reason to go to that extreme, and I absolutely loved that aspect about this novel.","Good book, but it just wasn't for me",1404604800,0,0,2,-1

"Derrick is a Circ.  He is big, bad, and lusty.  He is on the hunt for Sabrina Torrence, the woman who helped Kelly, a Circ mate escape Pearson labs.  He and his fellow Circs want to know why she did what she did and if she is a spy, they want to know that too.  What they don't realize is that the woman they are looking for isn't a human; she is a Circ as well and she is about to experience her first change.Book 3 of Marie Harte's Circe's Recruits, Derrick is a bit of a disappointment.  First, I found it hard to believe that Sabrina and Derrick cared for each other.  I couldn't sense any feelings other than hormones between them.  Derrick's feelings for Sabrina stabilized the farther in the book I read and that helped some.  Sabrina's feelings were off; she kept constantly trying to leave knowing full well she would be brought back again.  My second disappointment with Derrick had to do with the storyline revolving around Sabrina accepting Roane as her alpha.  I read the first installment. I KNEW Roane was mated so what Sabrina had to do to show submission to him angered me greatly. I almost didn't finish reading Derrick because of it.  That single scene ruined the entire book and I know I will not read this novel again.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Derrick,1264118400,4,4,2,-1

"This manifesto offers a set of five suggestions for individuals to increase their happiness and a set of seven suggestions for governments to increase the happiness of their citizens.The first set of suggestions have a common theme: a variety of activities that make many people happier.  However, there is a trade-off here: if a person wants to spend more time connecting, gardening, exercising, taking notice, and learning, they will have to spend less time on expensive consumption such as travel and living in expensive areas of the world.  There's a case to be made for downshifting, but this manifesto avoids confronting the hard choices.This manifesto also leaves out the role of religion in a happy life.  That is an enormous factor.  One can argue against it, but this manifesto just plain omits any discussion of it.  Similarly, having a family is the most powerful source of happiness for many adults, but this work mentions family life only in passing.The second set of suggestions also has a common theme: increase the power and scope of government.  I'm sure this will make one set of people very happy: the government planners.This is a Kindle Single, so it's short (good).  However, after filtering out the glib TED-talk, it's a bit too short.

This seems to be about as deep as the ""Ally"" character gets.But really, it's not only Ally's own personal nonchalance and lack of emotion that causes the detachment, it's also the fact that this whole story is written in a superficial third person. So, instead of experiencing what Ally is going through with any amount of familiarity, it's almost like you're sitting listening to a really boring (and possibly drunk) narrator drone on about some flaky airhead that doesn't have two brain cells to rub together.The author draws a poorly constructed scene, terribly shallow characters, an awkward and unbelievable storyline, over emphasizes points she's trying to convey, and then ends this whole horrid train wreck so rapidly your head spins.

I liked the premise of the plot, it seeemd like a good story, but there were too many factors that I found annoying that detracted from the story line:- poor editing - this can really make or break a novel, and it definately was notable here.- He spends most of the novel trying to resist falling in love and she spends the first half trying to get away from him, and the reasons for both of these just seemed poor. He lucked out and got a pretty wife when he was expecting a troll, be happy! His reasons for not wanting to fall in love were poorly defined and seemed ""lame"". Rarely are men ashamed of their past encounters, esp. in that time. She was living in a hovel  and being beaten prior to marrying a nobel - now she lives in a castle and is a lady! Sure she was duped into the marriage, but she's still better off than she was and has no where to go any way. Whats the problem?- Once she ends up in scotland, she turns into this complete kluts (which she didn't seem to be prior) and suddenly she can't even stand up straight with out falling into the man or pulling him down on top of her. It's ridiculous. Like reading a key stone cops scene. There has to be a better way for the two characters to have contact than wacky slap stick. Truly, that's just poor writing.- The animosity of his brothers towards him makes no sense.

"Best friends Starla and Jordan have always dreamed of becoming vampires. They thought it would be all glamorous and they would be wealthy. Turns out they were wrong.I had high hopes for this when I started reading it. I was looking forward to the friendship and the romance. I was disappointed. I usually love reading vampire books. This one just didn't keep my interest, I found it boring at times.Once Starla and Jordan become vampires they quickly realize it's not what they thought it would be. Jordan soon leaves Starla so she can serve the oldest most powerful vampire in the city. Starla roams the lonely streets at night deciding whether or not she wants to complete the transformation by feeding. Along the way she meets and falls in love with vampire hunter.This book was unique in some ways and it had a good story line but it fell flat. It started off slow and I thought it would pick up but it just never really developed into anything. I liked Mercer and the little vampire that Starla becomes friends with. I just wished that their story lines would have developed. I felt that the ending came to quickly. It felt rushed to me.I have read Uncommon Magic by Michelle Scott and loved it.

"First of all, this was a short story and I really am iffy about them, but reading the synopsis decided to give it a shot. Needless to say I was completely disappointed not only with the length of the story, but the lack of depth it held. It was just one big mindless plot of strange people, with crazy issues, and no real basis as to why or resolution about what happens with them or too them. The writing itself was good, the author has talent and honestly if this was an intro to his work, it was a bit of a letdown.

"This is typical Virginia Henley, nothing new. She uses her usual abusive language, dominant male character and dominant female character with court intrigue. I haven't read a Virginia Henley novel in quite a while because she uses the same style that becomes boring and a turn off with her overuse of abusive language.This novella is more of a short story that follows her usual pattern and that is rather loose. As it is short, there isn't much character or plot development. However, I think that a seasoned writer like Henley could have done a much better job. There is a better understanding of who Burgundy is, but not much is done with the hero, Nicholas. There is a disconnect between the characters that is mirrored in the plot. The reader is never really sure how they fell in love or why Burgundy decides to marry Nicholas. Henley uses two plot devices that are simply not strong: a letter and a book.Perhaps if Henley had spent less time using her usual formula and offensive language,she might have written a better novella.",Same old Henley and a loose plot,1358035200,2,2,2,-1

"Jane from Dear Author sent me this book to read to see if I also found it strikingly similar to Susan Napier's excellentIn Bed with the Boss, released in 1999. I'm surprised she needed validation, as the similarities go beyond striking and into egregious.In both stories the heroine is widowed young. Laura, in this book, has her fiance die in a car accident three years prior. Kalera, in Napier's book, has her husband die in a freak act of violence. Both books open with the heroine telling the hero, for whom the both work as personal assistants, that they have gotten engaged. Both heroes react angrily and both ask if she's pregnant. In both books, the heroine has gotten engaged to the hero's enemy, and that fiance is a jealous, controlling man in each book.From here the sequence of events deviate from the Napier book, but they are still all but identical, Wolf just shuffled the timeline. There's a scene in both books where the hero drives the heroine home when her car breaks down at work then comes inside and makes her dinner. He kisses her, they get hot and heavy, and then the phone rings and interrupts them, with the fiance on the other line. Both books have a co-worker pointing out how the hero acts differently around the heroine and is widely assumed to have the hots for her. Both books have the fiance sending out fancy invites for the engagement party, have the hero show up with the fiance's ex, have the fiance try to prevent them from entering and have the fiance and ex have an argument at the party. In both books, the hero and heroine shared a sexual encounter not long after the tragedy in which she was the initiator and which she wanted to forget, out of guilt. Both books even have a scene where the heroine is prompted to reminisce after smelling the hero's cologne, which the heroine gave him as a Christmas gift.I could go on. It would actually be shorter to point out what's different. Now, lots of stories have similar plots, but they tell different stories with them. This story took In Bed With the Boss and retold it, only shuffling scenes around and changing the names. The characters were the same people, doing the same things and reacting the same way. Sure, the book ends a teensy bit differently, as the deceased partner in this book turns out to have cheated on the heroine and fathered a child, but it's too little, too late. There's a word for telling a slightly different story with another author's characters: fan fiction.And the retelling is not an improvement on the original. Poor word choice, comma abuse and too much internal dialog renders this a drag to read. If the author used ""palpable"" any more than she had, I was going to start a drinking game. It was far from the worst prose I've ever read, but it needed an editor, and badly.If this had been an original work of fiction, I'd have given it a 2 or 3. Since it has copied an earlier work to a degree that constitutes derivation or plagiarism, I give it a single star.

"This story starts with all the right tools: an intriguing description, an unusual premise and series of mysterious events.  It is all set up impressively quickly (which was necessary given the tale's short length).Unfortunately we are given neither an explanation of the mysterious elements nor a destination worthy of the journey (either alone would have saved the story).  I was left wondering what conclusion the author intended the reader to draw from the ending.

"Ms Driscoll's novel was supposed to be about Waterloo, a British Military man, a woman disguised as a male physician. The premise itself is somewhat thin - a lady of quality disguises herself as a man to be a doctor.  As I began to read the story itself, I began to wonder if I was anywhere near a battlefield. Ms Driscoll gave us no sense of the place to inkling of the times. Her hero turns out to be a spy, and yes England had spies, but by the time the battle of Waterloo was engaged, the 95th Rifle Company was doing most of the scouting which is something quite different.Then there is Ms Driscoll's offhand remark that most of the nurses were prostitutes-- hummm.  Some were camp followers, yes, but many were also the wives of the common soldiers who fought there that day. Some of them were so near the battlefield with their children that they dashed out onto the battlefield in an attempt to pull their husband or common law husbands to safety after being wounded (this comes from eyewitnesses to the battle). Others were Officer's wives who came down the next morning from Brussels to look for their husbands.  And camp followers--official camp followers--were paid by the Army to wash and cook. The unofficial ones probably made a living selling their body among other services but there were not the only ""nurses"" at WaterloolThe immediate sexual encounter was rather over the top, given who this woman is supposed to be, but the author still gave me no sense of the place or time. I could have lifted her characters right out of the pages and slapped them into 1898 or 1920 or 1950 and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. I probably would have found her female lead more believable if she had been born in 1986 and transported back in time to the battle, but then the book would have been fantasy and not historical fiction.And, finally, there's ""Scots Whiskey.""  I serious doubt it was every referred to as ""Scots"" but I'm not prepared to research that so I'll  let it go, but I am darned certain that it has never been ""Whiskey.""  ""Scots"" or Scotch - made exclusively in Scotland -- has always been Whisky -  please note there is no ""e"" in Whisky.

"I both loved and hated this book, and for the greater time of my reading it, couldn't decide which. The beginning totally confused me. I couldn't figure out why Kate was gone, then was back at a wedding, then was gone again. Reading it on Kindle prevented me from rereading without a lot of trouble and figuring out what I missed, so I settled in to slog through the rest. Well, I loved Belinda ... for a time. I loved the use of first person and the ""these-thoughts-are-in-your-head"" feel of the sentences. It was as if I was reading all those things you think but never say. I loved that. But then the constant references to alcohol, page after page of curse words, the brief mention of drugs as if that was the most normal thing in the world, all got to me. But I was in the book now and wanted to know what happened to Kate. Then the author did what I hate the most, he took this character he'd made me love, ripped the bottom out from under her, stood the story on its ear, and removed what little morality she had left. Then I hated the story, and even through the end chapter, I still hated it. In the end, she had no redeeming qualities for me, nor was the final scene with her sister and Ben at the wedding even mildly amusing. I do not recommend this book.

"There is no ending to this story, and that's why it gets one star. It ends with an almost literal cliff hanger. In my preferred world, every book has a satisfying conclusion even if the story line is continued in some part in a future book. This is not like that. Hard to explain without giving it all away but suffice it to say that if you've ever left a book smack dab in the middle, this one does that without it being your choice. Just for that, I will not get the 2nd book to find out what happens, because for one, I resent the tactic completely, and secondly, after figuratively putting it down for a while, I won't care what happened.  I've never seen this done before.However if you can contend with this author's wierd tactic to coerce you into getting Ascenion 2, it won't be the worst read you ever had.  I'd give it maybe 3 stars. But it was also a really difficult plot to follow with numerous characters that you can tell are all connected, but it was just really difficult to follow all the threads. A couple of those character piqued my interest and I would have finished the book if the rest of had been there to finish. Mind you, many of the characters were pretty much caricatures.The other complaint I have is that it is in no way realistic. Everyone knows death row prisoners are not held in the general population, but in this book they're everywhere, sorting out the library, managing communications on the internet, showering and eating with everyone else. Then, the description of New Orleans was not authentic. Just because specific street names and restaurants are named doesn't make it real. Jac McElroy, the attorney protagonist is all over the city flagging down cabs. No one flags down cabs in New Orleans.  They have to be called.  I'd forgive a bit of that if the book had come to a conclusion. But I'm not going to be forgiving on this one.

"I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK.  I did anticipate it with excitement, though.  I read the first two in this series and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I really like sequels and the peeks into the lives of the former characters.  It makes the proceeding books seem like continued chapters of the first story.  The first book begged for sequels for each of the Grayhawk brothers and I was excited that Ms. Lee would write more about them.  I usually read the description of a book and then drop down to read the reviews.  I take them with a grain of salt, depending on the viewpoint of the writer, my interest in the description and my affection for the author.  Unfortunately, the reviews I read were very disappointing; so much so that I do not want to purchase this book.  There were a couple of suggestions for Ms. Lee, including making the next books more true to the characters and the theme of the previous books.  My suggestion -- which may seem a bit farfetched -- is for Ms. Lee to rewrite the third book.  The readers and lovers of the first two books, I am sure, would be forgiving if Ms. Lee were to rewrite the third book and keep Peyton true and believable.  I, for one, would be glad to purchase it and would heartfully await the stories of the other brothers with baited breath.  Ms. Lee, please consider it.  I would love to move forward in this series.

"The basic set up - King Henry VIII didn't die, but went secretly into exile on a remote island along with William, a son he sired off of some maid or other. Seventeen years pass and then Henry decides to return to England and put William on the throne (!!!), but first there's this little problem of his daughter Elizabeth being queen and all...I'll not spoil, but what follows is some of the most preposterous nonsense I've come across since the incredibly direHeir Apparent, although at least that one was bad enough that it was actually funny. This is not. As some other reviewers have already noted this book is heavy on dialog (some rather bad), and rather light on the plot - and a very silly plot it is.

Her dress seemed to be cast solid, never giving indication that legs worked to carry her across the floor.""A verbal exchange between Elizabeth and her father:""Ah! You die!

I will know no pity.""""I will welcome the torture, and I will open my arms to death in all its magnificence. So say what you like. I care not if you end my life, and I care not if this man is subjected to the same end.

"Having downloaded this book expecting to have a really good read, I was disappointed in how most of the story was depicted.There are some laugh-out-loud moments early on in the story, but after that things seemed to go downhill. I didn't like the heroine, because I thought she was a shallow twit. The hero was okay but a bit of a drongo in that he couldn't seem to realise that he had to actually have some training to run a department store.The romance was not convincing in that the characters hated each other, then liked each other and then hated each other again - and nothing had happened between them except - in time honoured fashion - a misunderstanding which could have been cleared up in two minutes. Of course that doesn't happen in romance books!The managers were unrealistic and silly.

It's not the worst thing I've read, yet it wasn't the best either.The protagonist, Emily Fenwick, is a police officer who is suddenly whisked into an alternate New York set in 1890.

Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads.

"Oh, if only the personalities in this book were a bit more mature. Instead the author has dumbed them down so they all appear to be in high school. To add insult to injury, all the main characters persistently do stupid actions which put them or their colleagues at mortal risk.I was looking for a book with mature, intelligent people. Instead over half the book seems to be dedicated to narrative or dialog about people with the emotional stability of a political talk show host. The loyalties of all the main characters are so flaky - that it is tough to envisage myself wanting to be teamed up with any of them.It was tough to look past that, but even then there were events that were unbelievable.minor spoilers below:...like the 200 mile walk by the cat...like the perpetual infatuation by group members with Bill the lazy dotard whose only redeeming factor is his ability to piss people off...like taking in people who previously shot at the main group...why would anyone beyond a halfwit ever do this?...like the wolves who only hunt humans during convenient times in the storuI'm not interested in future books from this series.

"For a more in depth review, please visit my blog, Chorley Chronicals ([...])!I can't say that I've really ever read a book of this calibre before. The synopsis was interesting to me and appears to have great promise! I first have to mention a huge peeve of mine though, which is, the title of the story is Roll of the Die, however, the at least one of the covers for the book (Goodreads eBook cover) depicts ""dice"" not ""die"". So I believe that the cover of the book is politically incorrect. It does appear that Audible's Cover is ""politically correct"", as well as Amazon's, so maybe Goodreads cover just hasn't been updated!I didn't care for the Narrator, Bob Dunsworth, too much, however, during the game portion of the book, he did an awesome job as the Commentator for the game being played! There was one point during the audio book that apparently the character he was reading for was eating, and I must say it was the most disgusting sounding thing that I have ever heard to hear the narrator sound like he was eating as he was reading. I felt that even though the character may have been doing that particular thing, that that particular thing could have been left out!The characters in this book were something else! During the game part of the book, it was hard to follow who was who by the simple identification of each person by color. I was constantly forgetting who Mr. Red was, or when they spoke about White, I found myself really having a hard time remembering who White was. This is part of the reason that I found such difficulty in enjoying this book.I can't say that I've ever read a book that was anything like Roll of the Die, but I must admit that Sean Patrick Bridges really had good thoughts that were put into this book. As I understand, this is one of his first major book productions, and that he has mostly written playwrights in the past, and that seems evident by his writing style. This book was a little more vulgar than what I am used to and the contect is certainly of an adult nature. I did find myself having a bit of trouble following along with the story throughout a few different parts of the story!Overall, I think that as an author, Bridges has much potential of becoming a great author. This particular book wasn't of my liking, however I think most of those reasons were just because of my own personal preference. I did find a few things that really swayed me toward a lower rating, but generally speaking, overall, I just couldn't say that I loved the book. I didn't think that the book was horrible by any stretch of the imagination, it just wasn't a book that jumped out as a favorite of mine. These reviews are the hardest ones to write because I felt that the concept was a great idea, I believe that the book just needed a little more deliverance in order to garner more stars from me. However, I believe that the book has very unique plot, one of which I believe could be easily transposed onto the big screen!",Roll of the Die - Unique Plot,1395100800,0,0,2,-1

"Not much to show for it. I realized that as a short book, it would not go into great depth or detail. However, instead of being- as I had hoped- a book looking objectively at selflessness and selfishness as different personality types and showing how one could use either to benefit, it was little more than a scold from your mother. Selfishness is bad and selflessness is good, and you just have to change from selfishness to selfness and your life will be ice cream and unicorns. Pure black and white, no nuance.In reality, almost all of us lie somewhere in the grey area in between. Pure selflessness is every bit as bad as pure selfishness when it comes to living in the real world. Selfishness in the right amount can motivate us, and selflessness can open us to possibilities and make us enjoy what we have. If you are not able to make use of both, a meaningful life will be a very difficult thing to attain.This one dimensional approach is not unique to this book. It seems to be commonplace in the ""self-help"" genre, so I cannot be too upset with the author. I will also give the benefit of the doubt in that the length of the book made it very difficult to impart any significant information. However, as an electronic book, the length constraints should not be a major issue. The author would have been much better served had they taken the time to flesh out their premise and address the subtle issues that arise when dealing with any two opposing concepts. A less judgmental tone would have helped, as well.We are all told as children that being selfish is bad. Then we grow up, and the selfish people are the ones succeeding. I would much rather have read about how you can use a balance of the two traits to get ahead without becoming a person you would not want to be than to be lectured again as if I were a child that selfishness is always a bad thing.","A quick read, but...",1325203200,18,18,2,-1

"I have been reading Stephen King since the 70's and I'm 54 years old. I am ""Constant Reader."" So, I take no pleasure in this review. This is one of the weakest things that ""my favorite author"" has ever written. I have stayed with Stevie because he is the absolute best at writing about ""pop culture."" I know he is very left wing but ""Under the Dome"" was still an excellent fun read. This was not bad political overtones or stereotyped characters. This was just not a story that allowed me to suspend belief and have fun. First, young children don't always act cool and ""hip"" when confronted by danger. A young 8 to 10 year old will rarely if ever think in terms of ""f-word this or f-word that"" as if he were a teenager getting ready for a party. Matter of fact most young children would not simply pick up a bottle of booze (vodka) and take a drink or two. The actual reaction would be ""Yuk, I'm not putting my mouth on that."" But, for some reason my favorite author in his mid sixties has lost the ability in this particular story to write actual dialog that might come close to a child's actual thoughts. Even, that can be forgiven. But, the ""Thing"" from where ever (don't want to spoil it) just doesn't make much sense. I'm afraid the whole darn thing just doesn't make much sense. I believe in Stephen King and I believe this was just a brain fart or a slip. I look forward to the Kennedy era novel this fall. I honestly appreciate Stephen King and have enjoyed his work over the years. But, on this one I will have to say. I wish I had taken a pass.",Disappointed.,1315353600,22,22,2,-1

"Right now, as I write this review, the kindle price of the book is 0.00. This annoys the living humbug out of me as I had to pay 2.99 for this thing.(ok... calming down now)This book is the reason why one must read book descriptions carefully. I originally thought that this would be about a modern girl going to the past to meet her ARTHURIAN KNIGHT. This was not the case.In the end it was basically ""Twilight"" with knights. As someone who isn't fond of Twilight you can imagine this did not sit well with me at all.I can't say that this was a terrible book. It will have it's fans. I'm just not going to be one of them.

"Described as ""a collection of short stories told from a different character's involvement and point of view,"" this is actually a linnear novella in which the POV changes from chapter to chapter. None of it was particularly great. Just a very surface description of some bloody conflict between the seelie and unseelie courts during a fancy ball, with almost no background, engaging characterizations, or engaging dialogue.I acquired this some months ago, and in the meantime Farrell has released a novel based on it, entitled Soul. I believe it was only after the publication of Soul that this shorter work began to be listed as a ""Prequel companion"", and it's not exactly that, as the events described in it mirror events that take place in Soul.In my opinion, having now read two novels and two ""short story collections"" (one of which actually was a short story collection!) by Farrell, as well as the first chapter of Soul, perhaps Farrell should stick to novels.

"This book has gotten a lot of good reviews and I guess I can see why - it has a unique twist on the mystical and magical; turning unicorn horns into an other-dimension portal.  However, despite the intriguing premise the story falls very flat.  The writing is amateurish, even sophomoric.  Short, declarative, unimaginative sentences with a large dose of misused vocabulary terms, rough transitions and awkward dialogue.  I got the impression the author clicked ""spell check"" and then called it good, which is never enough for a decent editing job.  The writing was just too simplistic (and not in intense Hemingway-like simplicity but in the Junior High short of way) and the plot was never used to it's full potential.  There were many points of interest the author could have expounded on or used to create tension and suspense but instead just skimmed over, leaving the plot feeling superficial.

"The story line of this book had the potential of being a dark thriller. Instead, it was a third rate novel with poorly thought out development and pedantic dialogue. With a mix of a serial killer seeking revenge, conspiracy by respected members of society, and a lack of authenticity as far as the criminal and legal justice systems work the result is a novel lacking any degree of actual thought.

"Katie McCormick knows all about the concept of adding insult to injury. Not only is her spoiled younger sister marrying Katie's ex-boyfriend in a four day event that is destined to make her stomach turn, but her mother is pushing her into accepting a date for the interminably long weekend with the son of her mother's best friend. Howie. They'd met once when Katie was thirteen and Howie about sixteen and the scrawny, nerdy brainiac didn't exactly endear himself to her. Her mother, though, is intent to torture her...though she's couched it in concern for hard family questions about her still-single status.Howard Jackson Kent, who goes by Jackson now, is equally disdainful of the idea when his mother pushes onto him the idea of accompanying Katie as her date. He remembers their one meeting years ago. Katie intimidated the heck out of him and threatened to beat him up. It was a less than auspicious beginning that he had no intention of seeing go any further. Nobody, however, can manipulate like a mother, and he reluctantly agreed as he girded himself for a weekend of torture.When they meet again, however, it's blatantly clear to both that the years have been kind. Katie's turned into a really cutie and Jackson's the definition of eye candy. As they get reacquainted and find out they have quite a lot in common, a new friendship and sparks of attraction fly fast and hard. Maybe their mothers weren't such horrible tyrants after all. And maybe it's true...love is really always in the last place you look.I had a pretty good idea very early into this novella that I wasn't going to be as happy with it as I'd hoped. Her sister not only stole her boyfriend, but is marrying him a year later. That's just skanky. And while Katie is now over it, I couldn't help but genuinely loathe her sister for that...and for every single scene she was in. The spoiled, petulant witch needed to have her bouquet stuck somewhere far less pleasant, let me tell you.But the story isn't about her sister. It's about Katie and Jackson. They were fine characters, though a little two dimensional. There's not a lot of time to develop characters in short novellas such as this, though, so I'm pretty forgiving about that. I'm less forgiving about the cliched aspects of the plot (five minutes in and I knew exactly when I'd see Katie and her ex come face to face), and as a reader, I hate romances that shove strangers together and have them falling in love and getting engaged days after meeting (or, as in this case, re-meeting). I'm all for Happily Ever After, don't get me wrong, but it's so hard to maintain a suspension of disbelief in those cases. It didn't work for me at all.The wedding festivities were, admittedly, over the top with the hijinks, but there was also plenty of humor there and I did appreciate how Jackson handled some of Katie's less than pleasant relatives and a few dicey situations. In fact, I don't have any complaints about either of them as characters and am forgiving of most of the constraints that the novella-length story put on the plot. It was the overall concept of the plot, the wretched sister from hell, and the completely implausible culmination of their weekend that I didn't like.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",I'm Glad Mine Are Brothers,1294185600,24,24,2,-1
"I can't recommend THE UGLY DUCKLING (ILLUSTRATED).  I tried it out because I wanted to have some kiddie books handy on the Kindle and this story is a classic.  Given that I read it on a Kindle 3G, I can't opine on the pictures other than to say that their placement often didn't match the text then on-screen.  Also, while it may be a reality of life, it was very disconcerting to have references to killing in a kiddie book.However, the biggest disappointment was the text itself.  There appeared to be no attention paid to how paragraphs and dialogue are properly formed and written.  ""Wall 'o text"" is bad enough in a regular book but in a kiddie book?  Major fail.  It made for less than smooth reading silently, much less out loud to a child.

"From the blurb I figured the book is very much what I like to read, so I had high expectations for it. The beginning of the book was promising, but it watered down from there. Around the middle I got the impression the author was a bit lost and didn't exactly know where she was going with it -- to be short, it was rather boring without any real context or connection to the actual plot. In some ways the middle seems to be part of a fully different book than the beginning and end.Pine got the story back together for the grand finale, and in my opinion she did a good job with it. I do think the blurb promised a bit more than what the book delivered. Though it is a series, so we might get more of that on the latter books. However the main event on this book wasn't getting his brother back.Devi was a likable enough lead character and Pine managed to make her a believable hot and cold teenager without being too annoying. Kim -- Devi's best friend -- brought a little spice, but she was kind of forgotten after the first half of the book. Oz is a strange but nice guy demon who seems to do a lot of things for the sake of the plot, rather than for his personality.The premises was an interesting take on the Christian mythology -- devout believers be aware, that it might be offensive to you. I wish some things would have been explained a bit more in the book, since for example I had to go and google the difference between spirit and soul to fully understand what was going on.I think the story has a lot of potential, but it's quite clear it wasn't ready for publishing and still requires editing. For example there's a scene where Devi and Oz goes to have some pancakes and after they've ordered their delicious carb bombs, they are suddenly back in Oz's car driving to the pancake place.To be honest I thought quite often, that I'd just mark this book as DNF, but I stuck through it.

After leaving the review posted a short time, I deleted my comments.Amazon keeps suggesting I read another book in this series, something that I won't even consider doing.  Partly for that reason, I have decided to post this review.  I use other readers' reviews to help me choose books.  I always read the best and the worst that is written before making a purchase.  I normally find that after reading a book, I don't agree with the negative reviews.  In this case I do agree.I really disliked this book.  I did not find the humor humorous, and the story just seemed to plod along.  I'm not sure the main character is intelligent enough to solve a mystery.  After two or three chapters, I really didn't care if the mystery was solved or not.There are many types of humor, and I am sure that this style will appeal to some readers.  I also look for a plot that really catches my attention in the first chapter, or an appealing character.  I did not find either in this book.  Since I read for enjoyment, I wasn't interested in seeing if the pace of the story picked up later in the book.If you are looking for mysteries set in the medieval period, read  Ellis Peters' Cadfael series.

"This is a short that continues where something left off or is intro to something coming.  Or, perhaps a little of both.The story (due to prequel status and also as after status) is not a complete story.  The characters were fleshed in prior story and are pretty unknown to any not reading first.  The end is not a finish - but a ""cliffhanger"" to be continued next book. Is outlined as prequel in description so fine.Still, the character fleshing could have been better for any not reading first.  As one is expecting cliffhanger due to description - the rest could have included a bit more back story.  So that any wishing to read this and one following could read as stand alone (when combined).  Without having to read first one to have running start when going to next.  Even in series types stand alones are stronger in my opinion.  I don't mind reading serials - but prefer NOT being beholden to reading entire an series to gain characterizations of intergral players.  A good example is the ""In Death"" series of books. One can read them in any order and still have a full sense of the major players as there is always some backstory to provide basis so a reader knows the characters right off.  This short hinted at some, but left one wondering where some thought processes came from and what happened prior. Which can be great inducement if the writing is done well enough to pull reader to go back and start at beginning and purchasing that book too.  I did not find the writing in this short particularly strong inducement to purchase further books by this author.The reasoning is due to some of the writing was disjointed and jumped about without smooth transitions.  Dialogue did not seem natural (to my ear) in some cases.  The overall plot was not cohesive due to the jumps between past cases of dead fellow, Roark's wife's past case, the case for the hiding agent or former agent, the disconnected thoughts between all that plus the human trafficking (though it appears is all supposed to be related - if so?  Poorly relayed in less than cogent manner).The premise is a good one (really quite good) but this preview is not a good showing of ability.  Story arc development and pacing need a lot of work.

"This is available as a short story and a novel (Spin the Plate: A Novel).  I imagine the novel does a better job of presenting the profound shifts the main character, Jo, undergoes.  In short story form, it is just too rushed.Jo is a unhappy woman who is a tattoo artist during the day and a street roamer by night.  She seems profoundly unhappy, for reasons that are made clear, throughout the course of the story.  One day she meets a young man, Francis, who reaches out to her.  The legal elements of the story seemed a bit far-fetched (wouldn't you go to the police to make a complaint of child abuse, not a lawyer?  And even if you did go to a lawyer, would the lawyer really ask you how long you wanted the person to be in jail and then make it happen?).  Jo's actions didn't always make sense -- like why she kept in touch with her family at all or why she visited her father.  Maybe these things are clearer in the novel.I would have appreciated a call-out in the item description that this was Christian fiction.",Not believable,1382227200,0,0,2,-1

"I hate to be the first one star review, but maybe if I write this others will have more opinions to go by and get a broader perspective. I can't believe the paper back is 14.99 - Kindle was .99 and I still feel cheated! I really liked the premise, but the actual writing and story line was just ""lacking"", so much. I kept reading hoping it would get better and it just got worse. I really wanted to like it, but. wow, it was bad. Here are a few reasons:- Poor editing, at least on the digital version. I find that truly detracts from any story no matter how good (and more so when it's not so good).- There was suppossed to be this sexual tension and subsequent sense of falling in love between the two characters and it just wasn't there. He avoided her and they barely spoke. Her family treated him horridly (based on his great great grandfather's previous treatment of her), and she basically went along with it. They never really spoke, so where's the love? Even when she believes he's a different person (which happened way too easily), they still never had the actual falling in love - they just were, and then the were in love. Lame.- He lookd like his great great grandfather so much that only the height and build are a bit off and no one notices? Really? People tell me I look just like my mom, and yet, if you were to put us together at the same age, we would look related but not enough to pass for one another. Yet he is practically an exact replica almost how many generations later? Lame. Then it happens again later (won't say how, but really, what are the odds?). Lame.- The use of cliches and colloquialisms in writng, especially narration of a story line, is just poor writing. Characters speaking in them can be justified if it is done to make a point or to embellish a time period, but if it is done repeatedly or anachronistically it just detracts from the story line and weakens the writing. It's also freaking annoying! :)- The end is just......ok, lame. I sense a pattern. So, yeah, if you were to ask me to sum up my review in one word, I guess we know what it would be. I'd go on about the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who still wants to read it. I do think the ending is just wrong though, and it harkins back to my sentiments about them truly being ""in love"". Well, maybe she was, but him, not so much.If you love time travel romance, the best I've ever read is ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. An incredible book. An amazing series.

"There were too many twists in this story to be likable.  I don't even feel like I connected with the main character at all.  It just really felt unrealistic that the main character, who is female, could do all the things that this author had her do in the story.

Chalked full of overly dramatic scenes with far too much description of Boston. It was like Mr. Sweeney was proving to the readers that he knew the city.

This was gifted to me by the writer which makes me feel even worse to have to say that her writing is sophomoric at best, tedious at the least.

"Overall, this was a fun story with a great premise. Like other reviewers, I found the first half to be the best. Robert's observations of primitive life showed that people are people no matter the century or spiritual beliefs. Yana was a spirited woman who knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to go after it.  The reason I only gave it three stars is because the second half really dragged on. Also, Yana lost a lot of her fighting spirit and seemed to accept too easily the life of a 21st century woman whose needs go no further than her closet.  Yana wanted Robert and she wanted an explanation for what had happened to her, but neither she nor her new friend, Nikki, did much about it.  The side story of Nikki's love life was also very disappointing. In addition, I would have liked some explanation, scientific or fantastical, as to how the time travelers were able to randomly observe people in other times.","Great First Half, Disappointing Second Half",1344816000,2,2,3,0
"Della Tsang is strong-willed, thick-headed, and independent. She is trying to live up to her Chinese father's high expectations of her while still being her own person and not disappointing herself. Logically, she knows ghosts don't exist, at least until she sees the cousin whose funeral she attended the year before running into a dark alley. When she follows him, she finds herself in the middle of a gang-war, and Chen, her cousin, saves her. Unknowingly, he also turns her. Chen is a vampire, and Della is about to become one as well. Forced to admit that not everything is so logical, she must now decide if she will fake her own death as he did and follow him to live in a clan or if she will travel to Shadow Falls and hope for a more normal life.This is a super duper short novella that showcases the story of how Della turned into the vampire she now is. The story is very simple and linear. I love how the change is written like a disease. Part of me feels like it could've been written to take up a little bit more time, but at the same time, it was written just well enough that you understand it without getting bored.Della is a nice character. She is strong and cynical, trying to live up to her father's super high expectations of her. She is starting to tire of it though, and is about ready to just run away from it all. She wants to move in with her boyfriend Lee and just start her own life. Living up to her own expectations instead of someone else. You don't get to go deep into hers, or anyone's characters, with how short the story is, but she is a good character that I am looking forward to learning more about.However, after beginning Born at Midnight, the first real book in the series, this novella becomes a massive disappointment. Within the first few chapters, you actually meet Chan and hear a bit of Della's backstory. Things don't match up. Namely, Chan wants to take her to Utah in the novella, but in Born at Midnight, it's Pennsylvania. Some of the other tidbits don't match either. Being that they were published no more than a fortnight apart, you have to wonder why the details would be so obviously different.Regardless, this is a really quick, easy, read. If you overlook the small details, then this is a good precursor to the main series. It isn't an imperative read, but it is usually free on Amazon so there is really no reason to not read it.Originally posted at arielavalon.com","Short, but a good way to wet your taste buds for the series.",1382918400,1,1,3,0

"This is a fast-paced story, bringing the face of technology and the internet up close and personal. The concept of six degrees of separation has always intrigued me, and I was interested to see how the author would play this out.The opening almost lost me, with the texting between Rachel and her friends difficult at times to decipher, and I feared the whole story would be at this level. Mercifully, it was not.The characters were each introduced abruptly, with only some immediate connection between a few of them. I hoped that as the story developed, their interconnection would become more apparent. Without spoiling the story, in some cases it did, but on the whole, I think it would have worked better for this reader's satisfaction to tie all the characters together by the end. It was somehow expected that it would be, so I felt left hanging at the end. There was simply no closure with more than half the characters. Also, I feel the author handled the characters unevenly, devoting more time to some and less to others, and leaving long, unexplained gaps of time in some cases. It was a little frustrating to have to make the leaps.I feel, too, that the chapter changes with the characters ran into some difficulty when the author moved back and forth in time. It was clear that background and motivation were being developed, but structurally, it wasn't sound. I think the chronology could be tightened up.In addition, the story is light on description. It's not fatal, but I would have liked more, and to have more context for the characters.Last, but certainly not least, there were egregious formatting glitches in my e-book. The paragraphs, especially in dialogue sections, were a mess and a challenge to decipher. This is disappointing.So in all, this is a light read that does carry you along. The characters are interesting people that you want to know more about, and there is certainly an element of fun.","A lively read, but three stars only",1303344000,7,7,3,0

The second part of the book barely rates 3 stars.  It is long, drawn out and delves a little bit too much into ""conspiracy theories"" to be a comfortable read.  It is almost, to me, like the author decided to change the plot of the book half way through.  Still, it is a decent read all the way through and worth it for the first half alone.","Long, but interesting enough",1350432000,2,2,3,0

Although it is solidly written, it just fell short of the mark for me.WARNING: MILD SPOILERS TO FOLLOWRod is a mega rock star who has battled addiction throughout his career.  Hawk is  a doctor and Rod's best friend who is always there for him, encouraging him to stay clean and live a good life.  They are both gay, but Rod isn't willing to settle down quite yet, and Hawk gives him breathing room.  Much time is spent from Rod's perspective, justifying why the two man haven't ever gotten together, despite a mutual attraction.  So when Rod finishes a long tour and Hawk meets him for the last performance, how come they end up in bed together with no angst at all???  This is the crux of my problem with the premise of the story.  Yes, I love the ""best friends become lovers"" plot, but the transition just seemed so abrupt to me.  One minute, they're friends, then next minute they are saying ""Should we do this,"" and a minute later (or so it seemed), they're doing the deed.  Hmmm.I really wanted to feel the love in this story, but it was just too short to develop any real depth of characters or relationship.  Yes, I was glad to see Rod step up to the plate and help Hawk with HIS problems, for a change (I won't spoil that bit here, but it IS sweet), but I finished this in about an hour and, when it was over, I just sort of shrugged.I think I'm probably tough on T.A., because when he's on, he is SO on.  His stories, when they reach deeper, really connect with me emotionally.  This one was a disappointment.  I give it 3 stars.  If you haven't read T.A. before, check outAngel's Evolution, which I think is my favorite of his (a 6 star, on my scale!).","Short, sweet, but not all that engaging",1299024000,2,2,3,0

Ava is a cool character, but some of the supporting cast fell short for me due to lack of depth. The plot also got a little overblown, with too much going on for one (short) introductory novel, while at the same time there was a lot of repetition, with Ava and co hanging around recapping things that just happened.There was enough to hold my interest that I'll probably continue to Book 2.

It keeps the pace well and is grounded in modern day as reality and something that could happen.It gets strange a bit fast without much explaining and what good they build up gets thrown away IMO by the ending. Didn't really make much sense to me.

"First, this is a stand-alone story and not ""a collection of five tales"" as is suggested by a review in the product description.This little novella is based on the premise that the protagonist, at some point in time, will encounter a black man named Johnny Devine at an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere, and that he will receive a ""gift"" from Johnny which might be helpful to him in the future.  That is all well and good, but for me...I had almost begun believing that the product description was wrong or that I was reading a different book by the time the gas station and Mr. Devine came into play.  That being said, things quickly go from bad to worse for our protagonist, and by the time all is said and done you are left sitting there staring at your kindle incredulously, thinking ""no way""-- but yes...""way"".This is a fairly well written novella, one which captures your fancy (after a bit) and then relentlessly and ruthlessly drags you and your psyche into a Hell of Biblical proportions, one which swallows you up before it regurgitates you back into your warm, cozy, safe little life...hope you're still breathing when you return.I really am torn on this one, as there were times the writing could have been clearer and, as mentioned above, I thought the progression of the book was a bit flawed.  Then again, it certainly met the qualifications of a supernatural thriller sooo...

"I think I was checking out new science fiction authors because I don't know quite how I came across this enjoyable story, but having just finished it I liked it so much that I began readingThawed Fortunes (The Guadel Chronicles Volume 2), apparently the third in a series, which gave the first chapter at the end of this book.  It's a coming of age book, which I suppose is aimed at young people, dare I say young adults?  At any rate, it is the coming of age of a young orphaned boy and girl who live in caves in a world of ice and snow.  They are both sponsored and in training to become what they are chosen for in adulthood.  I never thought I would care to read anything that I deemed to speak to magic but this has done it.  Of course, there are the adult Guadel of differing families who are the sponsors and teachers possessing varying degrees of ""magic"" and ""entering minds, or mind melds if you are a trekkie,"" of the young ones.

"Did I enjoy this book: This is a cute story with a happy ending. At first, I was unsure about whether or not I was going to like this book. I didn't know if it was going to be over-the-top religious or the complete opposite, over-the-top anti-religion. Thankfully, Mary Indiana is neither. This book had some funny moments, some scratch your head moments, some moments of disbelief but overall, I enjoyed Mary Indiana.Our leading lady - Mary - is a young girl who is pregnant but a virgin. Soon she finds herself seen as a healer, as a blasphemer, as a sign from heaven above, as a medical marvel, and as an alien experimentation. As the synopsis states, it is amazing how one event can be transformed into so many different meanings for so many different people. And how the internet can spread ""news"" faster than ever before.There are a lot of characters in this book, most of which are easy enough to keep track of. Besides Mary, the main characters are Violet, Joe, Ted, and Dr. Bob. Violet, though does not seem to want children or need a man in her life, becomes a good friend to Mary and there for her throughout her stay in Bellingham. Joe is a postal deliveryman who happens to pick up Mary when he finds her dirty and injured along the side of the road. He takes to her and she to him. He wants to protect her. Ted comes into the story later and, although his motives are not completely selfless, he does his best to help Mary. And Dr. Bob thinks he has found a new scientific breakthrough and wants Mary to go along with his tests so he can be famous. I didn't really like Dr. Bob in the beginning. But in the end, I did like Dr. Bob. There are also a host of secondary and tertiary characters that help this story along and make it what it is.Would I recommend it: If you like chick lit and happy endings, then, yes, read this book.Will I read it again: I will not read this book again.",cute story,1350950400,11,11,3,0
"So this was a fairly good read. It opens with Apollyon viewing mortals in the pools of hell. I think it was his job of sorts? He's been waiting for his master to call but it had been a long long time since that had happened. The less people that believe in angels the less he's called. Apollyon always seems to happen upon Serenity. He seems to find her almost as if he's seeking her out.Apollyon finally gets a call from his master and as he's seeking them out he discovers that the call was actually coming from Serenity, a witch.

She's a mere mortal. Well, a witch. Although, not much witchy stuff happens. More or less disappearing of clothing. So they seem to spend a good deal of time in the bedroom. A bit of steamy fun before seeking out her ex, Edward. After their revenge is served what's left for Apollyon and Serenity?I enjoyed this for what it was but the thing that got me was the fact that both characters kept complaining about not knowing what the other was thinking or feeling. If we brought it up once or twice, I'd say, okay, but when they bring it up every time they're together how in the world can I enjoy that?Anyway, that being said, I wouldn't mind trying the next story in the series.

"This review is split into two sections. The first section has to do with the subject matter and how it is presented. The second has to do with how it was formatted for Kindle.Part 1I picked this up for my Kindle because I teach The True Story of Hansel and Gretel. The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences. This doesn't happen on every page, but it happens enough to be very, very annoying.

"After enjoying Brett Battles' ""Becoming Quinn"" last year, the author had a bit of a ""halo effect"" going into my reading this book featuring a new hero.While a number of people have commented on the unbelievable attributes of Logan Harper, I saw no real difference between suspending belief in a novel and when I go to an action movie.Admittedly the plot was a little opaque at times, occasionally dragged and stretched credulity regarding the personal commitment many of these characters demonstrated for relative strangers, but I enjoyed the interplay and all-hell-breaking-loose last portion of the book.The text moved along nicely in developing thematic tension. Even more impressive was the fact that I only noticed one typo in the entire book (shinning for shining).MINOR GEOGRAPHICAL SPOILER: Since I have traveled to many of the SE Asian places where much of the story's action took place (not to mention having a Buddhist monk in the family), I probably could connect better than some readers with the Thai customs and settings.

"I was given a copy of C.I. Bond's Isn't Necromantic because the author wanted some real constructive feedback from readers.The truth is, the plot and world Bond created reminded me a little of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse novels, only Bond's main character, Cassie, is a little easier to relate to. Many who have read my past reviews of Harris's novels already know I am not a big fan of the Southern Vampire Mysteries, but I did enjoy Isn't it Necromantic.The writing was smarter, and the characters, especially Cassie, seem more well-rounded. As Cassie is drawn into an underworld society on account of her psychic abilities and the a strange lack of soul, she finds herself targeted. Taken into protective custody of the Sang (Twice Damned Souls,) she's drawn to her guardian, Julian. As the Sang battle each other for ultimate power and ownership of Seattle, Cassie hangs suspended right smack in the middle of their epic war for dominance over Seattle.Bond has classified this book as urban fantasy, claiming outright that it is not paranormal romance, but I tend to disagree. While the urban fantasy elements set this story smack dab in the middle of the modern fantastic, the romance mingles effectively with the paranormal characters that dominate the plot.Overall, I give Isn't it Necromantic 3 out of 5 stars. The plot was nicely crafted, and as I said above, the characters are well-rounded and believable despite their otherworldly nature. Their are some editing issues that need attention, but for the most part they don't detract from the story so they're easy enough to ignore.",A fun read with strong characters,1300665600,1,1,3,0

"Selene is setting off on a mission of sexual liberation for the duration of her vacation, but finds her past and her need to carefully orchestrate all her experiences, interfering with her enjoyment of her newfound freedom. This was a beautifully written account of a woman's search for herself and the internal conflict created by past baggage, however I didn't care much for Selene as a person. She was self-absorbed, vane, and callous in her quest for self-gratification, and her obsession with going in the opposite direction of her friend Janice, while using her behavior as a model, seemed hypocritical. Her interactions with Hudson, were interesting, involving many costume changes, and reflections on those custom changes, as their relationship developed.

She is only doing this for Granny because she feels she owes the woman so much.  Robin would never dream of approaching Shale otherwise because he is the man that broke her heart years ago when he left with another woman.Shale Anderson is a writer that has been living a reclusive life, caring for another woman because of a promise that he made years before.  He is scared for Robin when she shows up and begs him to return to Granny's house before it is too late.  He believes that when women are around him their lives or ruined or they die.  Can they both find forgiveness so that they can move on with their lives?I adore inspirational romance, but Snow Blind seemed short on romance with lots of inspiration.  The mystery was intriguing, but I felt that the characters lacked depth.  They felt one-dimensional for the most part and it seemed that other characters took away from any love story that could have been fleshed out.  I never truly believed that Shale didn't feel something for the other woman that he left Robin to be with.  The whole situation with the other woman seemed flawed given what is revealed about the strength of her character.  Shale and Robin never really spent much time together getting to know each other and falling in love again.  We are told that they do fall in love, but we are not shown.

"This was a fun, short, steam punk romance about a woman trying to retrieve a time piece her brother lost in a drunken game of chance. When I say a ""time piece"" I should specify that with it the holder can travel through time.The story was well written and nicely paced to keep the reader's attention. The characters were likable and the premise believable. As I read it, I couldn't help but feel that it would have been great if the author had taken the time to make it into a full length novel. Having said that however, it was a nice story that won't take much more than an hour to read.I really enjoyed the antics that Stormy went through in her efforts to retrieve the time piece. The fact that her mark outplayed her and then one-upped her was particularly humorous to me.

All in all, a solid entry from an independent author.The book is not really a romance book other than as told in flashback.  This book merely sets up the second book... where Rio meets her soulmate.

I loved how Darcy's art portrayed her mood and how her and Jordan could work together in their own versions of a trance.  I was pretty sure I knew who the ultimate betrayer was pretty early on, and I was right and disgusted by the finality of their ""love"".  While I really did love the story with the main characters, I was put off by a ton of typos.  It got to be really bad after a while.

"There is a lot of potential in this book and if you're the type of reader who enjoys looking for things to enjoy in a rougher book, this may be worth the download for you (especially while it is free).  I do, however, recommend it with strong reservations because of all the issues with the book.First of all, the book has an editor credited, but he appears to be related to the author in some way.  This is a book that strongly needs the attention of a serious editor.  The entire book is written in a bizarre, non-standard style.  There are dozens of exclamation points (outside of the dialogue, in the body of the book) that give it the tone of having been written by an excited teenager.  Any sort of transition or pause is marked by ""........"" which gets very distracting.  In a similarly amateurish way, timelines seem to be a little off.  I couldn't get a feel for how long John Lyon had been living in Kansas City - at some points it seemed like it had been a week or two, but his students were also asking about making up tests (which would be weird for the first week of classes) and he had a well-established friendship with somebody who we're also told he had known for just a month or so.The world created by the author is interesting, but it often has a ""Dungeons and Dragons for Dummies"" type feel.  It's a very surface-level world and you've got characters spouting off about being the ""Etherial"" or the ""Crystal-Mage.""  Since you're just dropped in, it can feel overwhelming, especially in the beginning.  And the whole ""It's magic"" thing is pretty much used for anything that might not make sense.Characters are rather one-dimensional.  King Yarro reminded me of an eco-villain from the old ""Captain Planet"" television show - not in that he wanted to trash the world, but that his motivations were evil in a silly way.  His interior monologue is just a constant stream of cartoonish evil - he doesn't care about anything but his own pleasure.  Even evil people usually think they're doing something right, it's just their take on the world is twisted towards their own motivations.  It doesn't make sense that this guy would hate his country and his son just because he's a bad guy.","I liked it, but don't know if I can recommend it",1317340800,6,6,3,0

"This book started off pretty good.  Although the FBI was already making decisions that just would not ever happen, I overlooked that for the sake of the story.  However, the main female character was just . . . bipolar.  I mean, she seemed alright in the beginning and responded like any woman would when faced with an insane scenario. I'd even say she excelled. Then, she began screaming at every surprise.  Preservation would dictate that you shut-up. IMO, the author has to work on avoiding glaringly obvious tactics to move the story along.  For example, why would you expose yourself to the bad guys by doing the very thing that is guaranteed to do so?  You'd need to be an idiot. The main male protaganist seemed like he would be a really good character.  He starts off that way.  But, then, how could someone with his qualifications not spot the things he missed?  Really?  It's impossible he could be the type of hero he's billed to be and be that clueless.  And finally, the ending felt rushed.  Not enough time was spent on fleshing this story out.

"Sometimes I can spend a stupid amount of time browsing through books on Amazon and I am always on the lookout for new authors with good write ups. This is how I came across Grant McKenzie as I noticed his debut novel had pretty good write ups.I had zero expectations, as normal with new authors and was pleased that as I started reading it was very easy to get into the story. As the synopsis explains and the story starts out, ordinary guy Sam White leaves his job early one morning and arrives home to find his house burnt to the ground. He then receives a call from a man claiming his family are safe and will be returned to Sam if he complies with the killer.Due to the story itself it certainly doesn't take long to get into the story as there is quite a lot of action in the first few chapters. I liked the style of writing by Grant McKenzie as he seems to follow the same route as authors such as Simon Kernick which are sometimes short snappy chapters. Although that may be true, there was a certain element missing which made me feel there was something lacking. I just couldn't quite put my finger on what.The story itself had all the right ingredients and the writing was good, but for some reason I just didn't like the characters all that much. The further I got into the story, the more I felt like I had `read this type of thing before'. Admittedly I do read a lot of books but this storyline just had too much of a familiar ring to it.Don't get me wrong, I certainly enjoyed the book, but it didn't leave a lasting enough impression on me to really stand out from the crowd. On reflection, I think this time around maybe I relied too heavily on other readers opinions and maybe I just didn't feel as strongly as others did. I certainly wouldn't be put off reading another McKenzie novel and I am hoping that maybe with a more original storyline I will like his next book more, but for some reason this one just didn't grab me all that much.Overall certainly not a bad book, just one that didn't have that certain something!",Average read thats missing something!,1323907200,0,0,3,0

"While a good editor would make good use of grammar and the appropriate use of commas, the author has a good knowledge of paranormal exploration and an imagination that creates an intriguing story.  While the poor sentence structure was distracting, the character development was admirable.  Both the primary characters and the less solid minor characters acted to weave a story that will not disappoint fans of paranormal investigation.  A lifetime of ghostly communications prepares Caitlin for a visit to Cornwall, the ancestral homeland of both herself and the family of the story's hero, Thane--and his identical, long-dead cousin, Colin, a resident incubus.  Together with her two close friends and Thane's family retainer, Caitlin explores the old manor house in order to identify and properly address any ghosts that may have lingered from the past.  Good and evil, real and unreal, the house's inhabitants provide adventure, romance, death, life and mystery in poorly-written phrases that provide light reading for the reader interested in a writer that shows a potential for future success with a good editor.",Editor Needed for Good Suspenseful Paranormal Romance,1334102400,0,0,3,0

"3.5 starsI really enjoy the world Rachel Vincent has created.  I like her writing style and creativity.  Plus, the books are set in Texas.  I love reading books taking place in my home state.This was one of the shorter novellas I've read.  The ending felt a little abrupt and definitely left me wanting more.  While I've never been one to read about ghosts or dead people, the content of Reaper did not bother me.This book is a must-read for fans of the Soul Screamers series.  There are no spoilers, so if you want to give Reaper a try to see if you'd like the series as a whole, go for it.  Just don't expect a full length novel.Just One Gripe:There seems to be some repetition: Vincent keeps telling us the same characteristics of the bean sidhes in each book.

"I subscribe to both Analog Science Fiction and Fact and [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  My Kindle subscriptions, delivered via the Kindle app on my iPad, save me from myself.  Instead of hunting down magazines at the bookstore--or wondering where they disappeared to from the mail--I just wait for them to show up.  Nice, low-fuss delivery.  And then instant reading gratification.Analog has about half of the science fiction content of its competitor.  It makes up for this with more information from the ""Fact"" side of the fence.  The factual articles, editorials and letters to the editor are interesting and occasionally very interesting.  They wouldn't stand on their own, but are worth the subscription price when bundled with the fiction.My personal take:  I like reading on devices like the iPhone and iPad that also hold a lot of legitimate, technical information.  Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I think I'm getting away with it, but I do enjoy reading Analog and Asimov's in a long, boring, all-hands work meeting.The recommendation:  If you only subscribe to one Kindle magazine for science fiction, make it [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].

"UPSIDE: Glamour is a quick read, intriguing, and unique. Great characters, lot of action, myriad of supernatural creatures (I loved the vampire - you have no idea if he's a good guy or bad guy, and you don't find out.)DOWNSIDE: Incomplete.The book left me feeling almost cheated.  As a standalone, it felt unfinished, but I'm sure if you download the rest in the series, the plot will thicken then leave you feeling satisfied when you read the last page of the last book. However, in my opinion, a book should FEEL complete in and of itself, not depend on subsequent material.There are other series stories that feel complete, that have a beginning, middle, and an end. You feel like there's closure to each one - the silo stories from Wool, or the Hunger Games, for instance. There's a larger story if you want to read them all, but they feel complete when you finish the last page of each book in the series.Glamour fails in that. It falls in with the kind of books I unknowingly stumble onto that run the same plot over a handful of books and doesn't feel complete until you get to the end of the series. I hate those. Vehemently.MORE UPSIDE: It's free.So go for it - download Glamour and see if it's something you like well enough to continue. Unfortunately, for me, it wasn't strong enough a story to send me racing to download the next book, although I will keep it in the back of my mind if I run out of things to read.

"This one is a really hard one to rate. I will say it now holds the record for the book that kept me up the latest ( three thirty in the morning for heaven's sake! I just couldn't put it down.) The suspense and mystery parts of the story were SO GOOD but the romance and overall moral of the story was SO frustrating!There were really only two problems (ok, the writing wasn't top notch in places but that can be over looked), the first is concerning the romance between Jack and Bella. Jack is a hired assassin who has been in love with Bella for 10 years, she is in love with him also but they have kept their relationship on the best friend level because of his profession. When things blow apart and they find themselves on the run and fighting for their (and their loved ones) lives, their relationship takes a major turn bringing all the feelings to the forefront. Jack has been holding out in a big way, however, and Bella starts to uncover all the lies and deceit he has been employing against her (in order to ""protect"" her). At least 5 or 6 times the topic is brought up with both the characters stating they will need to discuss and work these problems out between them. Jack must explain his reasons to Bella before she can ever trust him again. With all the action, however, these HUGE issues never get resolved, they have been the elephant in the room through half the stinking book and it NEVER HAPPENS! They just smile and walk off into the sunset together. AGH!!!!The other problem is probably personal. The killer for hire concept with the killer, who murders whoever he's hired to just for the big money, and with no remorse whatsoever, being the ""hero""- along with the contradictory plot where he is saving the son who's family have been assassinated by he and his associates just doesn't sit well. If there had been any redemption or remorse or change in attitude it would have worked for me. As it was, all good and bad just became a very dark gray. All were bad, the ones you root for are getting paid to kill indiscriminately, the ones you want to lose are also getting paid to kill indiscriminately, they're just trying to kill the ones we're rooting for. In the end, even the heroine goes to the dark side. Ick",A mixed bag,1292889600,2,2,3,0

When she inherits her grandfather's failing fitness clothing line business, Fite, she is thrown into the caustic world of the fashion industry.  Something she knows nothing about.  The closest Bev gets to exercise is when she was chasing down small children on the job, and the only thing she knows about fitness wear is that they are great for pajamas.No one expects Bev to actually run the company, especially the Executive VP of Fite, Liam Johnson. A former Olympic gold medal swimmer, with the body to prove it.  He wants control of the company and will do whatever it takes to get it.  Even if it means cozying up to the new owner.  He has no doubts that he can handle a 30 year old used-to-be kindergarten teacher.  It won't take him long to have her packing up and leaving the company to him, preferably before it is completely bankrupted!Add in a venomous aunt, self centered mother, tough as nails half sister, quirky neighbor next door and you have quite the drama.

"This novella didn't start off well for me - the characters got too familiar too quickly for being distrustful enemies. I didn't buy Graelen's willingness to sleep with the pretty innocent Rena (or hers with him, the big, scary, powerful witch) when he's spent his whole life hiding from women because of a terrible curse affecting his family for generations. I would have preferred a little more soothing of the characters' concerns before they jumped into bed, giving them the reason to let go of their fears. I couldn't quite connect with Rena (one moment she's a weak-kneed innocent, then next she's telling Grae off), but Grae was well constructed. As the story continued, the writing got tighter and the characters got more interesting. I'd be interested in reading the sequels because Cash seems like a tortured soul who needs saving (always a good thing for a romance writer to deal with), and there are two more brothers. I hope the connection point between the male and female protagonists is more believable.",A short lightly erotic novella with potential,1308614400,7,7,3,0

"The first third of the book flows very fast thanks to a quick pace and a witty style. But afterwards the narration becomes too slow and too wordy as Savannah's suspicions and theories are repeated and repeated. The reader's attention is lost in pointless descriptions of places, real estate's procedures and so on. Luckily, around the last third of the book, the story becomes more vivid as the mystery becomes deeper and more intriguing. Unfortunately,not as much can be said about the relationship between the main characters. The interaction between the two is very shallow and superficial. The supposed-to-be love story results more like an expedient to spice up the mystery's part than a thoroughly developed plot.  Savannah seems to have no idea of what she really wants in her life (especially in the love department), she's only preoccupied of what her family or friends think. Rafe is flirting with her but doesn't show any other real interest in her. She closely risks her life and he is nowhere to be seen for days and when they meet he doesn't mention anything about it or show any concern. I would have enjoyed having more romance there.","Good mystery,weak love story",1347926400,0,0,3,0
"I might have liked this one better had I not recently read The Baxter Trust, the first in the series.  I was dismayed that it contained so many of the elements of the first book.  I understand the necessity of having the new client tied to the one in the previous book, but two young heiresses and two victims engaged in blackmail and dying exactly the same way was a bit much.  Mr. Hall's style is fun and easy to read, and Steve Winslow is a great protagonist.  However,  the courtroom scenes, while entertaining, are grossly unrealistic, and a bit more imagination in crafting the next case will go a long way in encouraging me to continue the series.  A little proofreading would also be appreciated.  Among the other errors, an attorney says, ""with malice of forethought, "" when it should be, ""malice aforethought. "" An attorney would know that.",The Second Steve Winslow Mystery,1370908800,1,1,3,0

"- - No spoilers - -An epic fantasy tale about a young queen, Mina, who looks for a way to broker peace between her kingdom and its enemy, after generations of war. An assassin, aptly named Blade, sets out to aid her in her quest, and eventually becomes one of her trusted advisers and one of her prime tools in achieving that goal.The Queen's Blade is very well written, with excellent pace and some exciting action scenes. The exploits of Blade are well thought-out and executed. The formatting was a bit off at times, with strange indents etc., but overall it's a smooth read. My main trouble with the novel is that the plot is pretty straightforward, and very few subplots that do not appear to be more intricate.My main disappointment - as someone who puts much stock in character development - was the lack of depth in characters. They have their motivations and backgrounds, but they seem to lack true depth and were often conveyed through telling, instead of showing. That's a pity, since the main characters show promise.Another matter that bothered me was the abrupt, cliffhanger ending. I understand this is the first novel in a series, but I prefer a more defined ending than The Queen's Blade has.If you are looking for a fast-paced fantasy with some good action, and don't mind a somewhat linear plotline and the lack of depth in the characters, this is an excellent free e-book. If an intricate plot and character development are important to you, this novel might be a disappointment.","Good action and pace, plotting and characters lagging",1306454400,28,28,3,0

"There is such a big market now for the paranormal and supernatural books. These books are not new. They are just more popular. I have to admit that I've found quite a few that I've enjoyed which makes me prone to read those that sound interesting. I recently read Marisa Chenery's The Canuck Werewolf.This is the first is a series of books. It is the story of Rylee who goes on a camping trip with her brother and his friends when she meets a man that turns her world upside down. Atticus is camping because he is needing some time alone. He never expected to find the woman destined to be his mate. The fact that she is not a werewolf is going to be a problem with this family and pack.The storyline is great. I liked it. There was so much potential. I was disappointed in the character development. They seemed two dimensional. Then again this is just 61 pages so not much space is given to depth. Keep that in mind if you read it. It is a very, very short and will take you no time read.If you want a romance book that involves the supernatural, this might be a book for you. If you want a short read, this might be a book for you. If you're looking for a book that will keep you riveted for days, it's only 61 pages.Ms. Chenery has the seed for a great story but seems to be lacking in a lot of meat to the story and the ability to have me really wanting more.Note: I purchased this book with my own funds.",Left me Wanting More to It,1334188800,3,3,3,0

"While it's clear Lee Moan is actually a very good writer, with natural prose and dialogue, both of these stories needed a lot more attention than is given to them. Forever feels like it's missing half again its length, and 12 Minutes felt like it should have been a novel on its own but wound up being a scene rather than a complete story. They both felt like they were just starting when they abruptly ended with no real resolution or plot progression, a real shame given how well they'd been built up and written up til that point.I also didn't feel that either of the main protagonists were particularly deserving of any sort of animosity on my part, despite what seemed like the narrative trying to vilify them; a relationship goes both ways, and if someone isn't getting what they need out of it and the other person either can't or won't deliver it, then it does neither party any good to stay together out of some misguided conception that it's the ""right"" thing to do because the other loves them still. Neither of the male leads in these stories are bad guys... just guys, people who need something more than what they're getting. That's all.I feel like Lee Moan needs to write a book about either one of these topics, and I'd gladly buy it. As they stand, they're too-brief pieces of a larger puzzle that left me feeling dissatisfied.",Missing Pieces,1312329600,1,1,3,0
"I found myself internally debating on how to rate this book and what exactly to say about it. This book was not as consistent as the last one I read.

"This picture heavy (in a good way) little booklet is an excellent introduction to sewing basics.  It covers fabric, thread, tools, examples of patchwork and quilting, making bias bindings, and also a section on installing zippers.  What I like best about this book is that includes several tips that similar books assume you already know.  It also encourages the use of recycled fabrics (such as scraps from previous projects and cutting up old clothes that you don't wear any more).How to Sew is a quick read, it's simple and gets right to the point.  Each section in itself is well written, in depth and useful, but I don't know if it's enough to encourage a new sewer to get started.  It's like there is something missing that I cannot quite put my finger on.  I think this book would be perfect for an adventurous person who is looking to sew and already has a project in mind.The kindle format has an interactive menu, easy navigation between chapters using the 5 way controller, and the pictures show up well on my kindle 3 screen.

"Sometimes being girly is a lovely thing. Sometimes it is just plain difficult - like when you are camping in a national forest without warning! Being girly is what keeps Allie interesting. Her desire to shower (or bathe) and her desire to wear nice clothes keep her character interesting during her sparring with Clint.Oh yeah, her cursing and general ""potty mouth"" keep her character from being boring, too.The concept is familiar: the hero ""kidnaps"" the heroine, she attempts to escape, contacts someone, and before being rescued, starts to enjoy the time with her captor. Thus when she is ""rescued"", confusion ensues and drives the hero and heroine apart, only to be reunited by a secondary character for a happy ending. Both Allie and Clint have multiple layers to their personalities, and this is what keeps the ""kidnapping"" portion of the book interesting. Enjoying Allie's reaction to camping, and the lack of ""real food"" as well as her enjoyment of the outdoors keeps the plot from getting stale.One can not help but enjoy Allie's foibles: posing as a stripper, breaking a heel while trying to escape, running into Clint's mother while grocery shopping . . . it makes up for her whining episodes when she isn't getting her way.This is a nice, easy read.

"This book is set in the far future on another world, with a culture in some ways similar to Victorian England despite having some more advanced technology mixed in.  The protagonist catches a noble in a compromising position, and as a blackmail payment offers him a ticket to a secret school for 'regentrification', which will teach him to pretend he is a member of the upper class, and get a well paid job of some sort.The best part of the book is the middle.  There are a lot of amusing scenes in the hidden school, with the friends and enemies he makes.  If this sounds good to you, you might enjoy this book, but it has flaws.  The slang that the author invented for his lower class sometimes doesn't sound plausible, perhaps too verbose.There are a few other weaknesses as well.

JonesSynopsisUnknown to the humans who hanged innocent people at the Salem Witch Trials, Real witches of the hidden race were slaughtered on the belief that they had betrayed the hiddens to the humans.  Not one witch survived the genocide, or so it was believed for more than three hundred years.  Until one day a girl named Aradia moves to Salem, Massachusetts, and all that changes...~My Review~Aradia is found by her adoptive parents Ross and Liza in the wilderness.  From the moment they adopted Aradia ,they know something is special.  As Aradia grows up she finds that she can do magical things that no one else can do.Aradia is not your typical teenage girl.  Her parents move Aradia to Salem, due to a job transfer for her dad.She dreads a new school, but soon will find out she is entering a world of vampires and werewolves. Among these worldy creatures, there are many hiddens around Aradia.  At first she has no idea;  She also has no idea what she is.Aradia's dad is the DA to whom of which comes in to try and help solve a murder.  Aradia has powers to see things that have happened in the past and wants to help her dad solve the murder.As time goes on Rai (Aradia), makes friends and realizes the school she is now attending has some very peculiar things happening.  Her and her new found friend Roy, and her love interest Dax, go through out the story trying to figure out who is responsible for the murders. Along the way Aradia also discovers she is a witch;  The last witch!I have mixed feelings on this book.There were parts to where it would grab my attention and I would be very entertained.  Then I would come to a part to where it would drag on and explain much more than needed be.  I would easily get bored and it took me longer than usual to finish this book.

It just didn't hold my attention the way I wanted it too.There were a few editing issues, but nothing to make a huge stink over.In my honest opinion, it is one of those books that an individual would have to pick up and see for themselves.

"If you are looking for a classic disaster story, this isn't it. It is more of a scientific, political and economical story of the results of a huge natural disaster. Plus, the ever present love story, which seems to be obligatory to these type of stories. The author is English and there are several instances of ""Americans"" using English words and phrases. I am half-English, so I understood them and it took me a minute to realize the words were coming from an American. The same goes for the phonetic spelling of regional American accents. It's really quite funny. In any case, this is a good read for those of you who enjoy science and politics. There are a LOT of meetings and a lot of talking and explaining of situations. Often, too much so. The destruction of New York, sorry to give this bit away, is only a few pages long and even then, it focuses on engineering.

"I liked this book, but didn't love it. I enjoyed the world the author created and the alternate concept she has conceived for her vampires. A virus that can mutate in a person to either infect them or leave them a carrier -- the latter which must be shunted away to contain the spread of the ""disease"".While I have no complaints on the actual editing of the book - it was easy to read and free of errors, I didn't care for the way the story is told. A lot of writers mix narrative and showing to pull the reader in. Too often in this story we are simply told what is happening. But we don't feel it when our heroine is feeling it.When she's involved with the doctor and we're told she loves him, I found it hard to believe. She seemed detached from him and every other partner she had throughout the book. While I found the story compelling and I read it in a few days, I kept wishing for more -- more depth from the characters, more feeling, more rich description bringing us in -- but over and over the author ""tells"" us what happens and it falls flat.Also, the ending seemed rather abrupt. I won't spoil it, but there was no resolution with this book and it's almost like if you want to know how the story ends you MUST buy the next one. I would much rather have seen some wrap up with a lead in to the next story over being left hanging as this ending did.Overall, I think this author has promise and I will check out her other work.

Their response was anything but nice and so Elizabeth ran straight into the arms of another man.  Now, years later and divorced, Lizzy is tired of being away from home.  She yearns to raise her daughter in the small town in which she was raised.  The only problem? Hayden and Chandler Scott still live there and if the looks Lizzy is getting from the people about town mean anything, then she has been claimed by the two men who broke her heart years ago.Dakota Springs starts out with a bang.  Lizzy wants to come home. She doesn't want to see her men, yet her men love and want her now - all of this combines for a great storyline.  My problem is that this very exciting and intriguing storyline is rushed.  No back story is given other than the time the men broke Lizzy's heart and hurt her feelings.  And speaking of that, these men hurt Lizzy with the lies they told her. They were MEAN to her and frankly, I just wanted Lizzy to tell them to take a hike.Sort of one dimensional, Dakota Springs could have explored the relationship between these three characters a lot more than it did.

The main character Sebastian Furst, of the title, is shot in the head right at the beginning of the story and dies, well sort of. Confused well I was, I found it difficult to follow the plot as it seemed to go from dead to alive and sometimes not sure. The description of characters was good but I had trouble relating to any of them probably because the plot was not an easy one to follow. There were twists and turns as Sebastian searches for answers and on the way gets involved with a mystery girl, a religious (I think) cult and a policeman who stole Sebastian's wife at the end it is almost explained.

But the characters...I'm not from the south so maybe I don't understand, but the blatant racism and snobbery was a huge turn off for me. The main character's, Savannah, mother refers to someone as ""colored"". Savannah's friends from home are in her business and intrusive, and she is plain old snobby and spineless. She is more concerned with what her mother thinks than anything else. She refers to someone else as ""common"" and herself as raised better.  Now I just don't find a character like that likable. The character Rafe was interesting and great. I felt bad for him since no one would let go of his past or his poor upbringing. I was hoping Savannah would stick up for him but she never did and seemed fixated on his past.So with that, I did enjoy the mystery, I just didn't like the characters or the setting.",I liked the mystery but not the main character,1368230400,3,3,3,0

One evening they agree to let one of them cast a spell to find their soul mates and end up waking in another world. I like the world that the author built and the characterization of the girls quite a lot. The world includes griffins, which I like, but they remind me a bit too much of Anne McCaffrey's dragons. While the storyline is very entertaining, the author bounces from 1st person POV between multiple characters worse than a pinball. This interrupts the flow of the story quite a bit and makes it difficult to read, particularly in the first part of the book. If I hadn't been enjoying the plot, I probably would have put it down in the first half, it was that distracting. Improperly placed commas and apostrophes were also a problem.

I did enjoy the book on the level that I wanted to see what happened next, but when it did happen, I didn't understand why the author went in that direction.I also would have liked some more romance throughout the book. I felt that the main character was kind of cold. She was very flippant about her boyfriend and what happened at the end was just so detached. Doesn't display any depth of feeling whatsoever. The mooning over Mr. Impossibly Handsome was just lust, and the other male character she might form an attachment too she didn't really give the time of day. Overall, the romance was less than steamy and a bit of a let down. The idea was there, but not developed very well. I say if you are going to introduce it, do it right!The price was right on the book though so I can't complain that I spent a lot of money on it and I hope this author continues to write books and be inspired.

Basically no expansion on who the main character was. just a devoted reporter willing to use any means including her body to get a story and while that may sound exciting, it was mostly the narrator giving the outline. The plot twist at the end was too late in coming and didn't add to the story.If you're looking to for an adult read, pick this up; if you're looking for good literature, don't read past the cover.I'm giving it 3 stars because it was an exciting short story right before bed.",too many ideas that went nowhere,1294704000,1,1,3,0

Although most of the novel is set in Seattle, in one scene police officers set coffee and donuts on their car's bonnet, which suggests the author is not American, and perhaps explains some of the odd phrasing and sometimes stilted language.  That doesn't explain the often abrupt scene changes and the sometimes bizarre occurrences that are seemingly unrelated to the plot.

Of course I generally knew this story but I had actually never read Charles Dickens before.  I guess it was time and I looked forward to reading this classic.  I sure was disappointed because I hadn't realized how depressing it was.  Dickens' England was not a kind and gentle place.  It was cold and ugly and many people were very cruel.  The story was sad and my heart went out to the poor orphan Oliver.  But he was not the only one who lived a sad life.  All the characters were caught up in a web of unpleasantness and cruelty was everywhere.O.K.  Dickens is a fine writer and I understand how his works have met the test of time.

"This was kind of a hit and miss book for me. There were parts that I really enjoyed, but other parts... not so much. The great part about this book is that it's sort of a story within a story. A book within a book. I loved that concept and I think it was executed quite well.As a fantasy novel there is the quest aspect of the story, and that takes us into a magical land with spirits, magicians, and an enemy of the queen who has his own minion army. One part of the book that is memorable, to me at least, was the Evil Army Recruitment Questionnaire. It just made me laugh (e.g. one of the questions was ""Do you like to play with fire?"" and the two options were ""Yes"" and ""Yes!"").Bethany, our main character, is quite young seeming and naive. She's hiding something that comes to light part way through the story and I just couldn't believe what I was reading. It actually really turned me off the book. I was enjoying the fantasy narrative, but then we found out about this secret she was hiding and it was absolutely insane. I can't be specific about it because it would be a major spoiler, but it just made me wonder where Bethany's brain was at, it was so ludicrous.Some scenes in 'Running From Secrets' seemed almost rushed through, while others were well paced and thought out. Therefore sometimes I was really into the book and wanted to see where the story was going, and other times I was a little bored.

There is a presidential election about to take place, and the turning point in the decision is when one of the candidates finds a list of special people in his country who he calls terrorists. Since he has the plan, he gets the most support. But he takes it to an unconstitutional level and strips the rights away from these special people. It's like Nazi Germany, with segregation and abductions. Yikes. Paivi is in the mix. She's a special person, as she has a paranormal ability. Into the Shadows is her story.It's told in third person, mostly through Paivi's POV. We also see the POV of Senator Stevens, the aforementioned presidential candidate. By the end of this novel, so many things are left unsaid, undone, and unexplained. I know this is a trilogy, but at least SOME answers should be available. Absolutely everything is up in the air. And I still don't quite have a grip on the abilities of these people. Why do they have them? What exactly can Christian do? Are there different abilities? Why are they marked as terrorists? OY.Anyway, I didn't really like all of the characters. Her parents were very Brady Bunch sounding at the beginning, and the feel of the book changed all the time for me.

Sometimes she sees what is happening to another person while she dreams. It is like she is in their head, experiencing what they are, feeling what they are. While visiting American relatives, Keelin starts experiencing the nightmare that is happening to a runaway girl. She discovers who the girl is and approaches her father, Tyler. Understandably, Tyler is skeptical and believes this is a scam. Keelin is persistent and Tyler is desperate. Tyler figures even if this is a scam, she knows enough to maybe be in on what has now turned into a kidnapping. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer he figures. As they spend time together, inevitable feelings develop between the two of them and Tyler gradually begins to trust Keelin.There are four secondary characters, all of whom have it in for Tyler. One of my main problems with the story was that these were not all resolved. Some very big issues were left unfinished, including the whole family reason for Keelin travelling to America in the first place. The ending felt too rushed. The author wrapped everything up in a few paragraphs without resolving some of the major plot lines. With all the running about and initial mistrust, I was not convinced that there was enough between the h and H for them to have fallen in love, never mind be talking about their HEA.

"I'm only reserving  stars because the crime aspect was surprisingly without suspense or tension.  True, the serial crimes were heinous but non-violent.  (If that sounds impossible, trust me not to spoil the plot.)  I actually felt sorry for the killer as all eventually unfolded.  The clues were there, no red-herring  ploy - but there was no ""aha moment.""  And so as a mystery, I didn't get the page-turning aspect I wanted.  On the other hand, the book was well written, the characters fleshed out enough to be interesting, and some social issues were well handled.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not mind the Manchester tour:)  I also had no quibble with the Kindle edition mentioned by others, so, perhaps, it has now been cleaned up.  DCI Caton is the main, continuing, character in this first book, and he is mildly interesting if a little ordinary - divorced, early middle-aged, devoted to ""the job.""  The love interest is a profiler; that combo has been done to death - no pun intended - but they do seem a good pair.  The best news is that the entire 8-book series is available on Kindle, so if you get hooked, you can shop and shop.  I plan to continue with the series and see where this all leads.

The narration was amateurish and stilted at times in huge portions of the book, AND TYPOS LIKE WHOA! Major stumbling block for readers. In some crucial parts - like the one where they each realize they had fallen in love - so that the reader is left wondering, 'really? how do you suppose you came to that conclusion?' It's like the writer is trying to dictate the thoughts and feelings of the character to the reader instead of making them feel it.That being said, the author has a huge potential to be one of those authors the romance world constantly buzzes about, and this could even be the story to do it for her, but it needs some serious revision and proofreading.",Where's my prince?,1333756800,0,0,3,0

"I liked the book, but with reservations. I'm a dog person, so of course the dog as a main character encouraged me to try this. Good characterization, well developed main characters and a reasonably interesting plot although some parts of it seemed disconnected and difficult to follow.The first of two major issues was that I just flat did not like the main female character, she was short tempered, lost her temper (often without apparent reason) with everyone including her husband and did things that often seemed irrational.The other issue is absolutely a personal one for me. Why do authors insist on including a supposedly purebred animal (dog, horse or something else) as a character in a book and then give them attributes that absolutely do not occur in a purebred animal of that breed? I've been an animal person all my life, raised, trained and shown dogs, horses, cattle and rabbits and this just simply is one of my pet peeves. Either make it a non-purebred or do your research.","Not bad, but hit one of my pet peeves",1334016000,6,6,3,0

Well, with the expert grammar skills of the author (she is an English professor), it's as interesting as humanly possible.  This novella  length science fiction story started out fairly slow.  Its short length is a positive, as I'm not sure I could handle a novel on this topic.

He approaches her with the intentions of having his brother erase her memories of him. But something about her calls to his nature and the evening does not go exactly as he planned. He knows that he cannot be without her.PROS: The author weaves a good plot. The love scenes between Zan and Brant are hot.CONS: The character development could be better. We know very little about Zan and Brant. Zan came off as only being immature. When she met Brant, she was hanging out in the ER for a chance to meet a doctor. That's just wrong.Much of the middle of the book they spend separated since Zan has forgotten him. So at the end when they get their ""happy ever after,"" it's not so believable that she loves him and vice versa.It's a minor issue but it speaks to the plausibility of the plot; Zan never actually see's Brant's injury. She sees blood seeping through his shirt. Since she doesn't know how serious his injury was, there's no reason for her to question it and no reason for him to go after her.3 STARS: I gave it three stars since it is an interesting start to a series.

"Nicholas Buchanan, the Duke of Dorchester, is used to obedience, deference, and most of all, people--especially woman--falling over themselves to please him. Nick accepted an invitation to Ravenswing Manor to inspect a stud farm where he meets Alicia Woodley. Alicia has no interest in a Duke and intends to leave him to the clutches of her enterprising cousin. Nick is immediately intrigued by this anomaly: a woman who doesn't immediately fall on her back for him. Arrogantly, he believes it a trick to make him pursue her and makes a wager with his henchman that he'll bed Alicia in the end. Soon, things get out of hand. Alicia is fending of the attentions of her obnoxious cousin, Frederick, and the conceited duke as well as narrowly avoiding an attempt on her life. Not sure who to trust, Nick and Alicia come together to uncover the truth to why Nick was invited to be a partner in the stud farm and who or why someone would wish Alicia harm.So, this story was just alright. The strongest part was the plot: I enjoyed the mystery about the secret the family has been trying to keep hidden and the comeuppance in the end. (I always love it when characters get their just desserts.) The weakest part, which seemed to overshadow everything, was the romantic relationship between Nick and Alicia.I had a hard time with the romance mainly because the characters themselves didn't feel real--not just Nick and Alicia, but everyone. The uncle was a bumbling idiot. The aunt barely registered. The cousin was a deluded and over indulged female. The other cousin was a complete dandy. Nick? I tried to like Nick, but he didn't seem to come down far from his pedestal. I did like him more as the story moved on, but I really didn't like how he pursued things in the bedchamber. Alicia? She's everything we're supposed to like in a heroine: she's compassionate, she's shamed by her relations uncivil conversations and attempts to trap a duck, she doesn't care to impress a duke, she cares for wounded animals, and she teaches the illiterate in the local school. She was rather funny in her bedroom education, but I lost respect for her that she caved so soon to Nick's charms.All in all, it was a fine story.

"Joe has a job that requires him to travel a lot, but he also has his old family home that needs attention while he is away: the solution is to hire a house sitter. Tess is desperate for a change and an escape, so when she sees the ad for a house sitter she makes a call and throws all her belongings in her beat-up car and drives 6 hours even though he didn't really offer the job and she did kinda accept it. Now Joe has a house sitter with a small child filling his home and changing everything around him. When did life get so complicated?First off, this story was a great story. There was great character development, great analogies, and great romance. If everything was so ""great"" why am I only giving it 3 stars? Well, a few reasons really.Firstly, everything was so drawn out. Yes, it did help with the grounding of the characters and the changes in their emotions, but oh it just took forever for anything to ever happen.  It kinda sapped any enjoyment I had out of the story because EVERYTHING took too long. I felt like I was reading a 900 page book.Secondly, the book was written in a ""stream of conscience"" type of way where we are privy to the characters (and I mean ALL the characters) complete thought process. I'm not a big fan of this type of narrative. This is completely personal and subjective, but there you go. This narrative style also lead to the feeling of everything being drawn out.Thirdly, I had a few issues with Joe. He is a 44 year-old man who builds bridges for a living, which requires him to travel and work from different locations all the time. But, he has a woman stashed in each city. Now, these women aren't ""kept"" by him, nor do they expect commitment from him, but he shacks up with them whenever he is in their town. Now, it's not really this I had a problem with. The problem I had was that once he got into Tess' bed, he kept up with this behavior. He even talked to himself that he was a creature of habit, which is why he's now shagging another lady he has no real interest in; but Tess better not be talking to that Seb guy who came around last week asking for her. Nope, he can get his jollies off with some skank in France but she better be keeping house. Okay, so it wasn't really as bad as that, but it really rubbed me the wrong way. It smacked me of betrayal, of cheating, and of deceit--Especially because he made it seem, led Tess to believe, that all the other woman were no longer a concern...yet he goes a whoring as soon as he's gone.Usually, I'm not one for romance stories involving single parents of young children. I'm not sure why. However, Ms. Freya did such a great job in including little Miss Emmaline that she didn't detract or derail the story or romance.  Also, I loved how Tess had her friends and interests and helped define her.SECRETS was a nice contemporary chick-lit romance about how secrets can affect how you perceive life and keep true relationships from forming. A lot of bridge analogies were used, as Joe loves and builds bridges. This story is about the bridge Joe and Tess build to span their lives into a solid relationship together.",Drawn out,1325894400,2,2,3,0

I bought this book because of all the five star reviews.  I think they may have come from the author's family and friends.  This book was just so-so at best.  The first half of the book was actually boring with little action.  Most of the book consisted of the main character wondering if what he was thinking and experiencing was real or was it due to his paranoid schizophrenia that had surfaced after 22 years under control.  Was someone really trying to drive him insane or was that just his paranoia?  There were some good points in the plot but not enough to make a good book.  Fortunately it was a quick read and the Kindle formatting was generally good.,Not all its cracked up to be,1280102400,3,3,3,0

"I found this story entertaining and much too short. The story opens with a couple who has been married for six years.  The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden. That was a good analogy.I thought this was a sweet story, but felt it could have been longer with more detailed flashbacks regarding their courtship. I only caught glimpses of the wonderment that she wanted to recapture from the days of their courtship. I like stories with married couples who are not fighting. One sticking issue with me is the reference of the wandering eye. If you are as in love with your wife as you claim to be - should you have a wandering eye?  I had to deduct a star for these references.This is the second novel I read from this author and I am very impressed with her writing abilities to capture details of the moment.A recommend.",Scratching the Six Year Itch...a 3.5 stars ..it would have been higher if the story was more developed...,1403827200,0,0,3,0

"Between the Land and the Sea by Derrolyn Anderson is an exciting and thrilling young adult mermaid story. Surprisingly, I haven't read that many books on these particular supernatural creatures, so I was looking forward to diving into the story.Marina is a strong heroine who prides herself on being independent. Sometimes her closed-off nature gets her into trouble, because she doesn't want to burden others with her problems.  Like all good characters, Marina isn't perfect. She has flaws, but tries to work through them. I certainly wouldn't say that she is over her independent streak by the end of Between the Land and the Sea, I expect it is something she will struggle with throughout the whole of the series.This being a young adult romance book of sorts, Marina's relationship with Ethan takes up a lot of the book. However, it doesn't overwhelm the story. There are plenty of other plotlines that keep the romance from taking over things. Plus, their relationship develops at a reasonable pace. Marina doesn't throw herself at Ethan and Ethan earns her trust over a period of time. They also have ups and downs, which keeps things realistic. After all, these are teenagers - moods swings, hormones and all.As far as the secondary characters go, there were some I loved and some that were just so-so.  Abby, Marina's aunt felt very familiar to me, she reminded me of a lot of my friend's mother.  She was a bit offbeat and incredibly kind. However, Marina's cousin and his best friend fell a bit flat for me. I felt like they were one-dimensional and they did not really make a big impression on me. I also felt like at times Cruz's (Marina's cousin) storyline pulled the focus off of Marina's. Cruz's storyline certainly had a different tone than Marina's and it disrupted the flow of the book.Another element of the story that kind of threw me off was the sheer perfection of Marina's world. At times things were just too difficult to believe - and I don't mean her aquatic heritage. Marina was just too perfect - she's a brilliant, beautiful globetrotting teen who has a wildly successful father (he wins a Nobel peace prize) and an unbelievably rich ""Aunt"" who lives to dote on her with lavish gifts - I am talking about prada, Gucci and sports cars. Then, her cousin, Cruz, is supposedly this undeniably talented teen fashion designer (who Aunt Evie takes under her wing). I just think that Marina's real world is too far-fetched. These portions of her life are supposed to be rooted in reality and I just can't say that I bought it. The unrealistic aspects of her life certainly affected the overall feel of the story and I think that to a point, it hindered it.That being said, I did enjoy the fantastic portion of Marina's life and things that directly pertained to it. I thought that her relationships with and reactions to the mermaids were incredibly intriguing. I don't want to give plot points away, but things get dark and dangerous and I thought Anderson did a great job with the pacing. That's why I had a hard time with the ""realistic"" portions of the book - they created a light, fluffy tone, when I much preferred the darker feel of the mythical side to the story.Although I had a few issues with the book, I really did enjoy Between the Land and the Sea. Marina was an interesting character who is forced to deal with some very exciting and complicated challenges. Ethan was a decent love interest and I cannot wait to see their relationship develop further. The book had a few pacing errors, but when it was solely focused on Marina's storyline the pacing was spot on. I am looking forward reading the sequel, I cannot wait to see where Anderson takes things from here. This was definitely a great start to a series!",A Great Start to a New Series!,1310342400,0,0,3,0
"The Goblin Market is a lyrically written tale by a talented author. Her powers of description successfully drew me in, particularly the steamy darkness and evil of the Darknjan Wold. The characters were well-fleshed out and I liked that Merry was not the perfect goody-goody she appeared to be at the beginning. As the plot unfolds her resentment of her sister is revealed, producing conflicting emotions. Even the ""bad guys"" had other facets to their personalities.I didn't like the hero's name because my brain kept trying the change ""Him"" to he!I loved the story and the storytelling, so why not 5 stars? Misused words, odd choice of words, missing words, misused punctuation, missing punctuation, odd phrasing and typos became more prevalent the farther I read. There really are a LOT of them. They add a jagged quality to an otherwise beautiful story. This pulled me out time and again. I regret having to remove points for it, but there are just too many to be ignored.Still, I recommend The Goblin Market to those who enjoy fairy tale style fantasy.If you don't mind a read that becomes a bit messy, you'll enjoy it.

"This is a tough one to rate... It was slow paced and kind of boring at times, but it also managed to make me smile now and then.It was not an entirely boring or bad read, but nevertheless, it didn't really manage to capture my interest all that much. I didn't feel the urge to read the book in order to find out what happens next, what will happen to those two MCs. I just wasn't caught up in this book.Jae and Kelly were, on some level, interesting characters, well, interesting enough, at least. They're likable. I liked the fact that Kelly suffered from OCD, it was a good idea--attempt--, but it lacked believability at times. In my opinion, the research (by the author) on that topic fell a bit flat.And it's more or less the same with Jae's asthma: One time he's running like hell after Kelly and his ever-present sidekick Will which leads to ""the worst asthma attack Jae has had for a very long time"". So far, so good. Not quite realistic, however, is that Jae, while practically choking, can still have a conversation with Kelly at the same time. Well...There were some other things that weren't quite believable or that bothered me, but I won't list them all here. The ones above are enough. ;)The developing relationship between Kelly and Jae is sweet, I guess. I even like the houseboy-boy-toy Will, although he was annoying, sometimes.It was a nice enough read and I can't really say that I didn't like the characters or the plot itself, but the book never really was engaging enough, though.

"Let me begin by buffering my complaining with a true statement. This is not the worst book I have ever not finished. Okay, now that I have that out of the way, here is why I didn't finish this book. I have had a lifetime obsession with the Titanic and all things relating to the historical facts of the sinking. This book, although I knew it was fiction, sounded too good to pass up. This is a VERY LONG book and I was looking forward to settling in for a long read full of Titanic-themed entertainment. I have seen that quite a few other reviewers have already commented on the grammatical errors, so I will not go into specifics.This book seemed like with a good line edit, historical fact correcting and a little polish it might have been an excellent read. What I felt I got when I started reading this book, was a first draft. The sentence structure was clunky and distracting and the dialogue was some of the hardest to digest I have ever seen. When you combine those things with the amazingly bad research errors on dates, times and historical fact in general, I couldn't do it.

"So, this book was pretty good in the respect that it can hold your attention and keep the reader turning the pages, but it is definitely in need of an edit. The first round of sentence structure issues, grammar mistakes and spelling issues happen within the first chapter. Right out of the gate and I was already cringing that these kind of mistakes were published.

I was confounded at times by what the author was trying to convey with sentences such as ""She doubted she was any even in Georgia."" Huh? Beyond that, I felt this book if it were edited, would have been one of the better fantasy books I'd read this year. In the second half of the book the author really seems to take off, giving the reader a magical experience with vivacious detail and strong characters that make you care what happens to them.

"While this was a quick overview of the Oldest City in the United States, founded September 8, 1565, I questioned that so many historical events happened in the remainder of that year alone. That aside, the book was a nice overview of St. Augustine.As a native and lifelong resident, I'm well versed in the history of St. Augustine having my own library dedicated only to the city, so I do not make this statement lightly.Yes, St. Augustine is beautiful and many times it's said that it looks more European than anything else except, of course, Disney World.  People tend to visit Orlando, then come to St. Augustine with visions of the 'magical' world and unfortunately think Castillo de San Marcos was a replica of 'a castle' built only for their enjoyment.  (It was built 1672-1695.)St. Augustine is a living, thriving city with all kinds of vehicles, tour busses, cars, trucks, RV's, everything imaginable, so obey the laws just like you would in your own hometown, such as crossing at crosswalks, looking both ways before crossing. The usual.  Park at the VIC with convenient and reasonable price and walk, not driving by and just looking.

"The story is interesting, if you can make sense of it despite the formatting. The story has multiple characters and we jump between their point of views. We also jump back in time before the apocalypse. Not normally a big deal - except that there is nothing to separate these sections.You're reading a section with Harris and in the next paragraph, you're with Nero. There's nothing to separate the change of venue. Normally, an author uses chapters to switch characters, a line or an extra paragraph space. Not in this book - not my copy, anyway. And the time change.. what a mess - extremely confusing. There was a part where Harris goes back in his memories. It took me a few sentences to realize what happened. And then when we're brought back to the present - again, no separator. This lack of formatting removes any smoothness in the reading.. it's like driving on a bumpy road.There is a lot of military description - weaponry, tactics. If you aren't interested in it, you can skim it. The story itself, the world it's in is interesting on its own, as are the characters. The battle at the end captured my imagination - by then, I was used to the character changing lack of format and adapted a little better.",Formatting goes a long way towards clarity,1395187200,1,1,3,0

Sadly, what sounded like a very intriguing premise never lived up to its potential.  There was so much buildup ""what's in the coffins?"" ""who is the mysterious person"" etc, that when the resolution came in the final few pages, all I could think  was, ""Really?

"The usual (and forgiveable) typos exist (it's barren hills, not baron hills) but they pale in comparison to the flaws in what could, with some work, be a really excellent story.The plot has promise, and lends itself to a longer, and better written piece of work. The set up is great. We have a cast of characters that are well-defined and could carry a full novel. There are some flaws within the story's own rules (a man with no lips speaks very clearly - which bothered me). Structural issues around the repetition of ideas - we got it the first time, move on to something else - or present the point in a different way. Some of the metaphors made little sense as did the odd details.But the worst part for me was just when it was getting interesting - the story ended. And then started again. And then ended. And then started again. It was as if the author wrote notes on a novel and then published those notes as a short story.Of course it could use a really good edit (but so could everything self-published) and the author should take it down - expand it into a full novel (at least 60,000 words) and really do the story justice.

Although it was set in the future on a planet where city dwellers have flying cars and forest dwellers have psi powers it was really more of a romance than anything else.

"I agree with some of the other reviewers of this book in that I believe the race card is played alittle too strongly.  I believe that unfortuantely, there still is racism in this country and I understand that is what the author was trying to convey.  My issue was mostly with the parts of the book where the author decided to add in the main character, Will Pruett, a young black reporter's, thoughts throughout the book.  We get that he is black but he is an educated man who does not speak like a 13 year old street person at any other point in the book so stop trying to make him think in a completely different tone of voice than he actually speaks.  It seemed the author was trying to ram down our throats that he was black by adding these thought bubbles in and it was completely distracting and unnecessary.  You can't make him 2 different people, he is either an educated man who happens to be black or he is the disgusting stereotype of an uneducated black man who cannot speak proper english, pick one.  Other than that, the second half of the story was really good.  I was interested in the story line and the second half definitely had a twist I was not necessarily expecting which I enjoyed.  It kept me hooked all the way to the end to find out how the story would be resolved.

First she catches her husband doing the horizontal mambo with a red-headed hussy, when she seeks refuge in her office she stumbles onto a conspiracy for the theft of one of the valuable collections in the museum that she works for - or rather it stumbles upon her - then when she returns home and decides to confront her unfaithful spouse, she finds him with his skull bashed in and herself starring in the role of prime suspect.Set in the late 1940's we are witness to the whimsical experience of a man who has been released from prison after several years and is bewildered to find a world full of automobiles, televisions, and other new technological gadgets. In this story there is very little truth to the theory that there is honor among thieves and it is simply horrifying the deviousness at play.So just how does a wealthy socialite meet and become a close companion to an ex-con? Are they more than just confidants? Might they break the social class barriers, throw caution to the wind, and become more than just friends?

"PLOT: The first time Tammy and Eric meet in a bar it's the day he's been stood up at the altar and she's just learned that her college sweetheart is engaged to another woman. They meet again three years later on the aniversary of that day. Her sweetheart is marrying another woman at the same church where Eric's wedding was planned. Eric is there once again to see if his bride-to-be will show up. Eric asks her to marry him.PROS: The length is good. I liked the plot idea. The writing begins with potential. Eric was likeable.CONS: The main con is that it's unrealistic. It's three years after their initial meeting and neither of them has moved on? It's unbelievable at best and pathetic at worse. And it's an amazing coincidence that Marcus, Tammy's ex is getting married on the same day and at the same church that Eric had planned to marry Maria. I found Tammy's family to be unbelievable, violent, and unlikeable. I think they were supposed to be funny. Beating Eric with a shoe and a pan at a restaurant because Tammy eloped with him is not funny. Months pass before Eric and Tammy tell their families that they married.The author did a poor job of communicating the passage of time. Soon after they've married, time jumps forward to months later. Soon a year has passed.There were some vague areas. Like did Tammy have a job? What was Eric's job?The author is guilty of head hopping within a section. She'd start off in Eric's head and end up speaking from Tammy's point of view.This story could afford to be proofread. There were just a few errors and misused words. But some of the phrasing was odd enough that I wondered if English was the author's first language. There were some passages that I had to read a second time carefully just to understand the meaning.Tammy was too weak to like. She cowered to everyone, her mother, her half-sister, her half-sister's mother, etc. She actually fainted after seeing Eric's ex.2.5 STARS: I really wanted to like this story, but I was very disappointed with the tale beyond the initial sample.",Invisible Husband,1291248000,18,18,3,0

The mystery itself was decently done; at least it wasn't the obvious guilty party.I was bored with the entire sub-plot of Knighthorse chatting with God-as-a-bum in the McDonald's. I did not like that Knighthorse's cop buddy was so ready to dish out vigilante justice (no matter how deserved it was); I'd prefer to think a cop would at least have a little moral dilemma about helping out on that task.

I think (and this happens often) that the author becomes so preoccupied with historical details that they focus entirely too much on that instead of the characters.

Well it went better than I thought it would and I really liked the ending too. I won't give it a four star rating because I can't seem to forget the boredom at the beginning of the book. The main character Grace is always questioning and commenting everything and it was really annoying. I had to skip some parts to be able to continue reading 'till the end and it kind of me made me lose interest some times. After the exhausting dessication of her relationship with Mark though...it does become quite interesting and enjoyable. I liked Tom very much and couldn't really blame her for cheating on Mark with him either because Mark really pushed all my buttons pretty thoroughly. Most of all I simply relished Grace's happy ending.,Not bad.,1375574400,0,0,3,0
"This science fiction novel aimed at children over 10, starts slowly, seeming to focus more on the main character Cory's dislike at the way his life is changing, seeming almost a little whiney and annoying, but if you stick with it, the author starts to weave a good tale, full of rich detail and explanation. Any child with a love of science fictionand space will enjoy this book, at times it can seem a little stilted and perhaps some more editorial time would have really made this good book great.Managing to combine personal relationships with a good old fashioned adventure and a bit 'world saving' or 'universe saving', Cory is thrust into a world of terrorists, bombs and threats when he accompanies his father and new, rather interesting step-mother to the Midway Space Station, where his father works, of course all does not go to plan, and it is up to Cory to try and save the day.Either as a read alone for an older child, or as a read aloud, this book offers a rich world of science fiction adventure and trepidation.  The author has specifically written the book so that adults will also enjoy the story whilst reading to their children and she has achieved this, within the book there is enough adult sub text for a parent reading to enjoy the time reading aloud.KatieRazberry Juice","A good tale, full of rich detail",1348272000,0,0,3,0

If they both choose to follow the Lord, then healing from a painful past will be in their future.Let me start by saying I am a big Rachel Hauck fan. I love her books (Sweet Caroline, Love Starts with Elle, etc) and have passed those onto friends and made other Hauck fans! When I saw this ebook I wondered why it was so cheap. And after reading it I can see why. Obviously this is one of Hauck's 1st books. I feel like it could be greatly improved with some major editing.There are several times when she skips back to the past to tell a story, and I don't mean she's goes back 10 years to tell a story. I mean she constantly has Bella at a place where she remembers back to the previous WEEK and retells an important run-in or date with Burke. The story would have grabbed me more if Hauck would have just told the story in it's recent day order. There was enough jumping back to the past when they were in high school that we didn't need more jumps for short time periods. I know I'm not explaining that well, but I'm not a writer. ;-)Also the story started with such anger and bitterness. And I've read books that start similarly and it Can work. But something about this one didn't. There's no humor to lighten it up, nor is there enough warmth into Bella's character to help soften it. Over all Bella's character wasn't really shown on a deep level. I read in the back of the book that Hauck based the Bella character on her sister. I wish she would have given more depth to her in other areas. She only really gave us bitter Bella who hates Burke.Over all there was just nothing really captivating about this story. I feel like the plot line could have been great, but it just wasn't carried out well. I hate to say, I just would not recommend this book to anyone.

"From the description I expected either a thriller, a sci-fi story, or some combination of both. Instead, it was mostly about John Timmons depressing, messed up life. The book begins when John is just 24 years old and he's already experienced a life's worth of sadness, insecurity, and tragedy and it doesn't end there. Even as he starts to find his place in the world and experience some happiness, it's taken away from him yet again.John's relationships with his adopted parents are not fully explored or defined. He seems ambivalent towards them, but it seems clear that his mother loved him like he wanted her to.The device from the title really plays a very minor role in the story. It's not until the end of the book that we find out anything about it. Except for the government confiscating it, there's nothing thrilling about finding it. No chase, race. hunt suspense or any excitement around it.Jacob's ramblings were confusing and never really said anything. How John got any clues out of what he said beats me.A lot of the story revolves around John at work and with his co-workers, but those things aren't really integral to the story. It feels like his job and boss are just there to give him time off when he loses it and for him to meet Lisa.I found the great leaps in time somewhat disconcerting as well. John decides to make a life with Lisa, but all of a sudden we're 8 years into their marriage. There's nothing that shows their relationship building, are they happy, where are they in their lives, etc.The political culture of the times jumps around too. You're reading along, and suddenly something about the climate or healthcare is inserted into the story. There's no real setup of the circumstances or history of the political culture. I get that it's a warning about government control of our daily lives, but it's choppy and awkward.All in all, it was interesting, but confusing, vague, and incomplete.","Interesting, but...",1300752000,10,10,3,0

"It is a very short story and as part one of a trilogy does seem it would be better if they were combined into one book. Although a very descriptive piece of writing, with adult themes, there is little plot and it can be summarised as; a librarian steals a magic book, she is followed by werewolves, she is rescued by a werecat, the power of the book is revealed, she is turned into a werecat and the two werecats make love.

"(Cross-posted from the Adarna SF book blog)This is a solid, well-written, and intelligent science fiction anthology. I'm giving the stories themselves four stars out of five. My main gripe is with the minor editing errors, but I'll get to that later in this review.The stories move fast and pack a lot of punch. This collection contains both action-packed and high-concept stories. It has thrilling race and chase sequences while it explores classic sci-fi themes such as artificial intelligence, cloning, and first contact.It's difficult to pick my favourites, but ""The Breath of Heaven"" has to be one of them. It's about artificial intelligences gone ""rogue"" on the human space colonists. It turns several tropes upside down, and it's told from the POV of a very sympathetic AI character. The ambiguity in the artificial intelligences' directives leads them in the search for the ideal human operator, and consequently puts them in conflict with the imperfect colonists they're supposed to be answering to.I'm also fond of ""Dead Men Don't Cry"" and ""Backlash"". The former is a whodunnit murder investigation in the context of Earth vs. Colonies politics, and the latter is an action-packed time travel story with some interesting characters. ""Monument"" is a poignant reflection on first contact; while it's a bit of a downer, I think it's the most likely scenario. ""A New Kind of Sunrise"" is a set on a planet where human colonists have lost technology, and have become nomadic tribes who must cope with the extreme climate that comes with a brutally hot sun. The author has an upcoming novel set in this world, and I'd love to read it when it comes out.Fulda's writing is so tight that I think that you should only read this when you're alert. The world-building and character histories she covers in one paragraph would require an entire page from other authors. This is evident in the first few pages of ""Pastry Run."" So if you sample the book and the details fly over your head: get some sleep, then read it again. Trust me.I received my review copy from Smashwords, and there could be improvements to the editing. I noted about 13 errors. It included some typos, line breaks within sentences, and dialogue that clumped together in a paragraph which made it difficult to figure out who the speaker was. Maybe I'm just picky, but I found these distracting enough to dock off one star. It's possible Amazon copy does not share these, or that these errors have already been resolved, but I can only provide my rating from the review copy I received. Once the errors are fixed, consider this a four star review.This is a solid sci-fi book and it's definitely recommended. I'd just wait until a more polished version comes out before purchasing it at Smashwords.Note: A free review copy was provided by the author.",Action-packed and high-concept stories that pack a lot of punch.

The author lets us follow the murderer, a broken soul affected so much by his childhood and by the Vietnam war, the small-town policeman who is severely affected by the murder, and various people who come in contact with the murderer.I found the first few chapters intense as the author sets the scene and sets the initial escape and actions of the murderer and other characters.  I became bored by the rambling introspection by each character and wanted to jump ahead to find out what would happen.The ending is bittersweet as some things end well and others continue a rapid decline.","Well-Written, Intense, but too Introspective",1378166400,1,1,3,0

"The primary reason I am giving this book just three stars rather than 4 or 5 is that this book is an English translation, and the job of translating, although adequate, is far from perfect, and often  very clumsy. It reads well enough to be understandable, but some readers may find the dicey English phrases and improper grammar distracting while trying to absorb the challenging concepts presented by the original author.Despite this flaw, Universal Mysteries is a book I hope a lot of people will read. This is exactly the kind of ""expanded"" perspective on the nature of religion and God concept that millions of people would do well to consider.Certainly, there isn't anything in this book that has not been revealed or proposed elsewhere -- by other philosophers, Zen masters, Christian monks, New Agers, even secular scientists -- but it's extremely helpful to get yet another take on how to think of, or envision the Universe as one giant ""Intelligence Singularity"" (my term, not the author's) that, at its most fundamental level, is the base of all reality, and is something that can never be divided from the ""oneness"" of itself.I felt I got a fresh look at a subject I have been long familiar with -- I only wish I could have granted this book 4 or 5 stars, but native speakers of English will be in for an unpleasant surprise if they are not made aware of the awkwardness of the translation.UPDATE: SINCE I FIRST PUBLISHED THIS REVIEW, I UNDERSTAND THAT A NEWER, CLEANER TRANSLATION HAS BEEN ISSUED. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE THE LATEST REVISION, BUT IF IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT, THEN THIS BOOK GETS MY TOP RECOMMENDATION. THIS BOOK HAS AN EXPANDED PERSPECTIVE THAT I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO PONDER IN TODAY'S WORLD.

"All Juliet van Allen, aka Mrs. McLeod, wanted to do was go home early to make love with her husband. Instead, she wound up with a dead, adulterous spouse, an ex convict as her new chauffeur, strange men climbing through her ventilation system, and a detective convinced that she's a murderess. To top it off, most of the happenings are printed in the paper each day, courtesy of an ethically-unbound reporter. Simmer, stir, and let the plot thicken.Cadmium Yellow, Blood Red sets up a deceptively simple scenario: a murder, a museum heist, and the intersection of two very disparate lives. It is this overlap, however, that brings the story to life and lends it more interest than a relatively rudimentary whodunnit might warrant. As a heroine, Juliet successfully blends ""damsel in distress"" with ""independent businesswoman,"" sidestepping the wealthy heiress trope that could easily have flattened her into a caricature of a character. Even more enjoyable, however, is the way in which Elmer Vartanian is fleshed out. He is neither brash knight nor tortured hero; rather, he comes across as a decent man trying to piece together a good life for his family. His attempts to find his daughter and circumvent the fate laid before him were what kept me turning pages (or flipping Kindle screens, as it were).The pacing of the writing in this novel is a comfortable combination of action and conversation, with just enough detail to set the mood or to present an obvious, albeit effective, metaphor. Various bits of history, specifically art history, stimulate the reader's mind and lend some credibility to Juliet's position as museum curator. In short, as a vehicle for storytelling, it does quite well for itself. Unfortunately, the second half of the book contains a multitude of typographical and grammatical errors that detract from the overall experience of catching killers and thwarting nefarious plots. Further editing is warranted.Story-wise, Cadmium Yellow, Blood Red is a fairly neat package from beginning to end. For those looking for a relatively quick read, that may work out just fine. Personally, I would have preferred a lengthier story, perhaps with more red herrings and meaningful interactions with the appropriately named Rattinger; the search for Kurt's killer was far more straightforward than I'd imagined. From what I can tell, however, the murder mystery was not intended to take center stage in this book; if anything, it's a convenient backdrop for both Juliet and Elmer to widen their horizons.Hide and Read(Review copy provided by the author)","A good mix of mystery, characterization, and art history",1327017600,1,1,3,0

"George is a teacher who supplements his income by helping out at the local gym. Lonnie, a regular gym goer, has a big mouth around the boys, but in business he's all professional. He has a client who's injured and won't be able to play football again - yet he's barely able to read. Lonnie asks George to coach the resentful young man and give him a future.Darren, aged twenty-four, is late of the Philadelphia Eagles; good looks and athletic ability have taken him through life without his needing to worry about education. Darren is bright but an undiagnosed dyslexic. He's also secretly gay. George is gay, but while he's not flamboyant he doesn't hide anymore. The two have a heart-to-heart and decide they can work together on reading. Darren can now aim for a TV sports presenter job. George has a dodgy hip from birth, but Darren assures him they can do upper-body training in the gym together. Darren couldn't possibly be flirting, could he?There's a lot to like in Andrew Grey's stories, and this 'Workout' series with running characters gets to feel like a bunch of old friends. Darren already knows that his former high-school buddies just want to hang out with him so he can pick up the bar tab, but now he learns how to read a menu and gains confidence. A positive read - less gym time than some and it will probably be better marked by gay people.",Crunch time,1369094400,0,0,3,0

"Since no one had reviewed it yet, I thought why not me? I was so close to to loving this story. The characters were likeable and relateable. Their love story went a little fast but I can even understand that. What I didn't like was the way conversations between characters went. No one speaks that when in casual conversation. To me the author or editors focused more on proper grammer than on how it would sound if someone actually spoke that way. And the one thing that almost had me screaming bloody murder, is buying a book with this many typos, wrong words, and words together where there should be a space.

"Because I liked the way the story started I hope book one is a teaser.  There seems to be a trend (please make it go away) to publish chapter-like books that require buying the chapters under the guise of buying books in a series.  (Why not just sell them labeled as chapters?)  I digress.I was emotionally hooked with the beginning.  I can understand that this book was not about Steele and plan to read the next book and have all my hopes for the story are realized--sort of like 'the rest of the story'.  Stand alone, this book was entertaining and I would enjoy it in a waiting room but certainly not enough to spend 'I want a good book to read' money.I like that what was told of the story was easy to follow, easy to buy into.  I say that hoping that in the next 'chapters', the story are about Steele, how he came to be the man he has evolved into and what kind of partner criteria he has that meant he was wide open and available when she came along?  There was nothing about Steele in this book.  He was a boy, then he is a man, a force to be reckoned with in her living room.

"For years, vampire Raphael Laurent has watched Lord Aleric Vane from afar.  Aleric is the third son of a duke and his unwillingness to give into his father's demands has left him without funds, but with the freedom to do as he pleases.  Raphael keeps watch over the object of his desires, but never makes contact until Aleric is attacked.  The attackers leave Aleric near death, so Raphael rescues him the only way he can - by turning him.  But turning Aleric into a vampire only creates problems instead of solving them.  For to save Aleric, Raphael broke an unwritten rule.  One that may cost him the one chance he has at an immortal life with the man he loves.From Afar starts off on a high note with a tempting mix of longing, action, and vice.  Unfortunately, while Ava March hooked me at the start, my attention was lost less than halfway through the story.  From Afar is disappointingly unmemorable.  Raphael and Aleric were likeable and the sexual tension between them was laid out on the page, both basic elements of an intriguing tale.  Yet nothing in this story came to life for me, which was a pity.  Don't get me wrong - there is nothing to dislike about From Afar.  The ingredients for an entertaining story are all present and Ms. March's writing flowed smoothly, so perhaps even though From Afar didn't capture my attention, it will grab someone else.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",From Afar,1269561600,1,1,3,0

With no homeowners or health insurance, how fortunate that Grant, her father's antiquities competitor, is anxious to purchase the house and business, giving her enough money to take care of her father. It tears Delia apart to have to give up the home she loved, but had been forced out of when her father couldn't deal with Delia's ""delusions"" of speaking with statues. Delia talks Grant into allowing her to handle the restoration to the home and it becomes difficult to keep her affinity with statues a secret as she and Grant become close.At the same time a cousin Delia had no knowledge of, has plans of her own to get ownership of the house and Grant, and she's not going to let anything get in her way.This debut author has written a rather unique story. Statues made from hand-carved stone chatter amongst each other and Delia hears all of it. Some have become friends and family, and it's these statues that make this a charming read. It's easy to connect with Delia and feel her emotions.Some will notice that liberties were taken with hospital protocol and procedures, but on the whole this is a good story and an author to watch out for.

"Summa Theologica by St. Thomas AquinasThe Summa has been the gold standard for Catholic thinking and teaching for over 800 years.  It is said that St. Thomas ""baptized Aristotle"", that is took his pagan philosophy and put a Christian spin on it.  Since I know little of Aristotelian philosophy and the accompanying vocabulary, I frequently had difficulties following many of the more obtuse presentations.  In general, Thomas would take a subject, eg. Angels, dissect in into a number of subparts, and present it in a series of questions.  A ""straw man"" would answer the question and then Thomas would prove the straw man answers were incorrect.Many of Thomas' medieval assumptions seem quaint to the modern reader.  For example, there are only four elements:  fire, water, air, and earth.  Some of his literal interpretation of the Bible flies in the face of modern biblical scholarship.  Thomas asserts that man has seven souls, each with a function such as intellect, digestion, locomotion, control of the senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc), memory, and maybe a few functions I can't recall.While I originally bought this book as a possible source of spiritual inspiration, I am afraid that a more contemporary work would do better.",Summa Obscura,1376611200,1,1,3,0

This one of the three lacks an explicit love scene, though the romance is interesting.

"This has potential to be an interesting book, but not as it now stands. The book has purportedly been ""edited"" since the original self-publication date so I assume I was reading the ""improved"" version. The story premise is of a dystopean world divded into the Citizen's Haven where the privileged reign supreme and a slum-like underworld where the unwanted live in the shadows and risk being turned into lobotomized slaves by the Citizens. The author had me from the word dystopia, but syntax errors and awkward, juvenile word choices really took away most of the pleasure of reading it. I'm thankful that the majority of typos referred to in previous reviews were cleaned up or I couldn't have gotten to the end. Still, it was slow going. There are some interesting ideas in the book. I enjoyed the suspense around the character Jeffrey and cared what happened to him. I would have liked Kaylee better had she not been so one-dimensional. Her character lacked subtlety and substance. I found Jeffrey and Michaels and maybe Malcolm to be the only characters who showed some realistic complexity and thus earned my interest. I wanted to care about Kaylee as there was ample opportunity in the frightening and gritty circumstances she found herself in to really make me care, but the lack of development of her character had me rolling my eyes at times. She was too reactive, a cardboard cut-out of a tough young girl survivor, lacking a level of tenderness or vulnerability or emotionl substance that would have made her likeable or even believeable.  Most of the other characters need some work, too, to give them some dimension and the storyline more credibility.  I imagine I would have enjoyed this book had the author hired a professional editor to really edit the issues of syntax and to provide guidance in fleshing out the characters..

"I received ""Diary of the Displaced"" by Glynn James for free from [...]  ""Diary of the Displaced""  is about James, a man who has somehow landed in the land of displaced things.  Anything that has come up missing can wind up here.  There is no light, the dead continue to stay lost there, it includes zombies, strange barbaric dogs, a maniac, and all the trash you could ever want to sift through.I guess I would call it science fiction.  I am not really into science fiction, so I wouldn't call this one of my favorites.  James isn't very clear.  You can't really like him, because you know very little about him.  He spends pretty much the first half of the book looking through trash and figuring out how to live in the displaced land.  The second half picks up in action, chase  and fight scenes, a little mystery.  If the first half had been less trash sifting and more character info I would have liked it a lot more.  Second half of book was pretty good.",diary of the displaced review,1319328000,3,3,3,0

"Ruby just wants to figure out why her sister fell off the radar. Leaving Chicago and coming to Denali, Alaska is the last place she wants to be but if it gives her answers then she will do it. Waking up in bed to a naked Adonis was not part of the plan though, even though she would like to cozy up and have her wicked way with him her sister comes first.Carson knew that Ruby was his mate the minute her sister Melanie showed him her picture. He has been waiting anxiously to meet her especially since he began to dream about her. Worried that she is going to run when she finds out he is a shifter, he is confused when she doesn't balk instead she has a ton of questions she wants answers too. How is he going to convince her she is his mate, if all they do is talk, time to get creative.I thought the overall concept was a lot of fun, loved the beginning thought it was a hoot.

"Dix Dodd is a PI, out on her own after spending too many years working for ""the boys."" When she's offered a large cash sum to follow a wealthy woman's husband around, she's eager to take the job. Before long, though, that woman is murdered and Dix finds herself framed for the crime. Not only is she being framed, but the detective on the case is none other than Detective Head - a man who she's busted for cheating on his wife before, and who has a huge grudge against her.The story is humorous and I found myself laughing out loud at times. I love the way she was framed, but I was not too impressed by the way she solved the mystery at the end. That single ""answer"" she was looking for seemed a bit weak to me. Things didn't seem to fall together perfectly in my mind. It almost seemed as though the writer had an idea in her head but didn't completely convey it on paper. I also would have loved to see the underlying romance bud a bit more by the end, but who knows - maybe there's another story for that.The Case of the Flashing Fashion Queen was a good read, especially for someone who isn't really a huge mystery fan - like me.

"I'll admit that most of my problems with the book are related to my personal preference.  It is a very well-written, thought-out, and developed book, and I'm sure a select audience will enjoy what it contains, it just wasn't for me.  I  thought the world building was great, and the cast of characters diverse.  There were space battles, innovative technology, and even a dash of romance.Now, I enjoy having things explained to me, especially when it contributes to the mental image I can bring forth when looking at a fictional universe. However, in this book entire chapters were devoted to the descriptions of the technology and the related physics involved, as well as the extensive workings of the political sphere and social changes as described by the passive voice. This took me out of the story, made it a struggle not to skip ahead,  and screwed with the pacing of the book.  It also sacrificed character and plot development which could have helped the flow, and (IMO) more action which would have made it a more fast-paced, enjoyable read.I also disliked the protagonist and found him an annoying perspective to follow.  He, and various minor characters, were not simply naive, but held a sense of idealistic pacifism about them that made me shake my head and think, 'surely you can't be this stupid'...  He was also whiny, sheltered, easily distracted, and incredibly trusting; leading to him refusing to believe anything was wrong until everything had gone to hell.Finally, the book was just plain depressing to read.  The same political, religious, and social problems we have today are prevalent some fifty odd years in the future. The essence of humanity, our ability to rise up and conquer anyone and anything that threatens our existence and freedom (something most military scifi novels embrace) simply wasn't there.  Humanity almost self-destructs, they're treated with suspicion, experiences defeats and failure at the hands of others, is at multiple times at the complete mercy of others... This coupled with a disappointing and lackluster ending really made me wish I hadn't pushed through the difficulties to finish the book.","Depressing, but well-written hard scifi",1332374400,2,2,3,0

"VAGUE SPOILERS IN THE REVIEWI will be honest when I first started reading this book I thought that somebody else wrote it under Amy Lane's name, so two dimensional I thought the characterizations were. Obviously this is the subjective opinion of one reader and what did not work for me may work perfectly for other readers, but for me, it just did not.And I never ever thought I will say it about Amy Lane's book, but Bella was giving me Mary Sue vibe. I mean, she is amazingly beatiful, she is great friend and yeah she supposed to have a temper but this only makes her more vulnerable, which is not a real character flaw in my opinion.And seriously do not get me started on Asa. He is a perfect husband and what happened between him and Deidre was not really his fault. Yes, I know what happened to him, however I was just shaking my head because Deidre did really bad thing and poor guy just seem to had no choice in the matter really.At least Sebastian, had to make some tough choices at the end and yes, I believe he really did grew up, but I wished I would have known more about him.I mean, I liked the story, I liked Jonathan and I will definitely continue buying Amy Lane's books, but out of the four books I read I feel that this one is the weakest.","Fun read, but a lot of things did not work for me",1282003200,2,2,3,0
"This decently entertaining short novel is the first installment of Guido Henkel's supernatural adventure series starring his Jason Dark, Ghost Hunter creation.  Though the writing in this self-published offering is sometimes a little repetitive and clunky, it never sinks to sloppy or slapdash levels.  Besides, the scene setting and descriptions of Victorian London more than compensate: both aspects are moody and effective, nicely drawing the reader into Henkel's world of demons and supernatural investigation.My other criticisms are basically quibbles. I would have liked to see more dialogue between Dark and his supporting cast members; it would have enabled us to get to know everyone a little better, as well as break up the large blocks of dense description (usually of streets and buildings) in the prose.  Also, an occasional plot twist or dramatic revelation would have punched things up a little, especially at the end, where all we get is a long fight scene (though not a bad one).  But, again, I liked the moody, creepy vibe Henkel delivers throughout, and more importantly, I cared about Jason Dark and the people around him.From reading Mr. Henkel's book description here on Amazon (as well as his recent blog postings), I learned that I apparently just missed a revised version of ""Demon's Night"", which includes a new cover, a lower price, and a polishing of the prose.  So the most recent version of this book might be better than I'm giving it credit for here.  It's certainly cheaper.Will I come back for more?  Sure.  While perhaps lacking the crispness and total polish of a novel one might pick up at your local book store, the sudden availability of interesting self-published offerings like Guido Henkel's Jason Dark books on the Kindle more than compensates for any slight shortcomings in the final product, at least in this case.And, as we all well know, it's not like ""officially"" published books are perfect, either.",Eccentric little ghostly offering is worth a look,1299715200,5,5,3,0

"I give this author full marks in engaging me in the story. I went from beginning to end wanting to know more and more about Jay, Anita and CAIN as well as what was going on in the story. However when I got to the end and it seemed the three very characters that made the book interesting, well, were less for the story, I was disappointed.It is an excellent first book to build on a universe, and launch the series though. Well written, and as I said engaging. It conveyed the excitement of testing the first FTL drive of humanity well. Then first contact with aliens was as exciting as one might imagine. Full of hope, then everything goes south. While overall in the end the universe is better for it, the three people I investing interest in the story were in worse shape at the end than the beginning.I was unsurprised by the way the author went with the AI at the end, its the trend it seems. Technically Anita may have been better off, but this is not a feel good ending kind of story. Save for the state of the universe.The author writes well, and probably has some good stories coming up with the set up this book has been, but I don't think I'll be giving him another read through.Good points, the writing, the world building, the characters and even the battles are very well handled.The bad points, the ending. Normally I say that if I've really loved and book and didn't want it to end, this time its I arrived at the last page disappointed.It is not a feel good kind of ending, it is a good ending though.

"Allegory seems an allegory of the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory. A rather good one too. The characters learn in a place between Heaven and Hell to pray, repent, do good deeds and so on to be let into the City up ahead. I was surprised, however, when the last scene negates this, stating it is about the need for Christians to do these things in this life. Which is surprising. The main part gives the impression that Christ's salvation is useless, or at least insufficient unless we do these works. Salvation by faith will not save you, as one character who believed and didn't go through the whole discipleship regimen was seen in hell, even though some he lead to Christ got to go through the Purgatory. The last scenes do not erase this impression.

It takes maybe 10 minutes to read.

Riley Blackthorne is a Demon Trapper, and this book gives an account of her doing a small scale demon capture.  Riley seems like a plucky character, but the story is too short to really know.

This is the third book in the series and I have to say the characters I most wanted to see receive their happy ever after. The problem with the story was that the characters were entirely different from the previous books in this series.

"Interpreter for the Dead was overall an enjoyable, quick read. A fine introduction to a new series of mysteries, despite being riddled with typos (far exceeding the 5 stated by another reviewer).I enjoyed the author's accurate depiction of the region where I currently reside. He captured the scenery and the quirks of the residents quite accurately. The dependence upon the deaf community that sprung up around his parents' home and the deaf school was a unique element. Yet it was carried out with tact and balance. Despite my reservations I found I had no trouble rooting for the ""bad guy"" to come out on top. Key points of the plot were somewhat predictable, but I find that relatively common in this genre.If you are a reader who finds typos and wrong words distracting you may wish to move along to a different book.

"Who or what is there to keep all the paranormal nasties (Vampires, Werewolves, Ghosties, Sirens, etc)  in the world at check? What stops them from going on a rampage, making front page headlines and causing mass panic throughout human society? In Chris Adonn's story, The Eyes that See, it is a highly evolved and secretive race called the Balancers. A race so secretive that to learn of them means death.The Eyes that See, released in March 2011, is a prelude to Chris Adonn's Balancer Series. Where the supernatural world is watched over by The Eyes that See, an ancient secret society in existence since the 5th century BC; it is their job to watch and document all supernatural beings. Adam Smith a fledgling research member of The Eyes that See, has discovered indisputable proof of a new undocumented supernatural race.  Fredrick Bradfield, head of the South African Division and Adam's benefactor has been searching for proof all his life that Balancers actually exists, a supernatural race that keeps the worse of the supernatural creatures from exposing paranormal beings to humankind.  Together, Adam and Fredrick enter a world where such knowledge is taboo; dark secrets are exposed threatening the ancient organization with ruin and meet the secret that is required to silence them.Being that the story was a prelude to a larger work of fiction, the book was a fast read; the story line was well written and guided you through the character interaction at a good clip, keeping you involved in the plot of the tale.  The lack of descriptive narrative on each of the characters physical forms left the characters half formed, leaving it up to the reader to decide how they looked; there was also a large lack of description of scenery and setting which detracted from the short tale giving it a feel of being unfinished and rushed.  Though  the character's personalities did come through the way they spoke making it easy to see their quirkiness.The premise of an ""immortal policing race"" was intriguing enough to keep me reading to the end to see how it all sorted out.  I found the ending a bit disappointing considering the ominous over tone of taboo and threat of death weaved through the story; how no one was allowed to be aware of the existence of the Balancers. The manner in which  the conflict was resolved at the end was quaint and extremely anti-climatic.  But considering that this was a prelude to a greater work and the storyline interests me I will crack the cover ofLegacy  - Book One of the Balancer Chronicles, in hopes that Chris Adonn has put a bit more time in character development and Scenery description.",Has promise ...good story line,1306800000,2,2,3,0

"Outside of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creation is the scientist and adventurer George Edward Challenger. Professor Challenger starred in three novels and two short stories, beginning with The Lost World, first published in 1912. Edward Malone, a journalist of athletic build but timid demeanor, seeks an interview with Challenger, hoping the eccentric misanthrope might provide some good copy for his paper. Though at first Challenger is hostile to the reporter out of a general hatred for those of his profession, he soon takes a liking to the young man. The relationship between the two characters is very similar to that between Holmes and Watson, except that Challenger is a bigger jerk than Holmes and a far less intriguing character. Challenger reveals to his newfound confidant that in the Amazon rain forest he has discovered a remote plateau where prehistoric creatures that have long been thought extinct still thrive. When Challenger makes his findings public before a meeting of the Zoological Institute, he is confronted by doubters. To test the veracity of his claims, an expedition is hastily organized, consisting of Dr. Summerlee, a rival scientist; Lord John Roxton, an aristocratic sportsman, and Malone, who volunteers for the journey in hopes not only of finding a good story but also of adding some much-needed adventure to his life.Malone is the narrator of the tale, and most of the book is written in the form of letters sent back to his newspaper. This makes for an awkward construction, as it becomes clear that at the end of every chapter Malone is going to be safe in camp scribbling his account, while some overly convenient method will be contrived for an Indian to carry off his letter to the civilized world.The Lost World is the prototypical tale of a team of scientists venturing into unknown lands, upon which Jurassic Park is just one of hundreds of descendants. In typical Conan Doyle fashion, the story starts out at a rather slow pace, with secrets being revealed gradually over time. Though this challenges the attention span of the 21st-century reader, there is a charming freshness to the sense of wonder expressed when remarkable discoveries are finally made. Dinosaurs live! It should come as no surprise that the expedition eventually reaches the plateau and finds the prehistoric creatures in question. The fact that the adventurers are not travelling back in time, but rather visiting an area of evolutionary stagnation, allows Conan Doyle to indulge in some evolutionary anachronisms. In this world, unlike in prehistoric reality, dinosaurs coexist alongside prehistoric mammals, ape-like humanoids, and modern Native Americans. One of the book's disappointments is that it does not spend enough time on the dinosaurs, but brushes by them rather quickly in order to focus on the apemen, at which point it becomes just another white-man-conquering-the-savages story. Throughout the book, the expedition members seem less concerned with practicing science than they are with invading a new territory. Towards the end of the book, the expedition team makes a choice that no scientist would ever make, a choice to destroy rather than to preserve. The overall message of the book, rather blatantly stated, is one of the superiority of man over nature, and, less obviously, of white European men in particular.Though it was perhaps ground breaking for its time, and it's certainly a step above run-of-the-mill pulp fiction, The Lost World has since been surpassed by many of the imitators it inspired. Those who appreciate classic adventure fiction will find much to appreciate, but it should not be considered a must-read by any means.","Classic adventure, questionable science",1357084800,4,4,3,0

"In this Novella we meet Elizabeth Shallcross a governess for Lord and Lady Wheatly, they have just come from back to England from a 3 year stay in New York. On the docks Elizabeth is saved from being nearly run down by a cart, by Richard Graham an employee of the Lord Wheatlys' who has come to meet their boat.  Elizabeth is leaving the Wheatlys' employ, but not before she returns to New York to close up the house there, and assist the leasing agents.  After a 3 week visit with her family she comes to get her instructions from the Wheatly's.  Only to be asked to act as governess to Mr. Graham's 3 year old daughter for the crossing, and for a short while, upon their return.  Elizabeth doesn't want to do this, as she has other plans.  But she has fallen in love with the less ridged class system in the U.S. and so she agrees.  So on an April morning Elizabeth joins her charge Kathleen, and Richard for the journey to New York, their ship... The Titanic!I can't say this is a bad book it isn't, but I never really got the growing attraction between the two main characters.  The author tells us that Richard sees ""Beth"" as his equal, any student of history will argue that Americans of this period were every bit as classist as the British; a pretty young Governess traveling alone with her handsome employer with only a 3 year old as chaperone?  I don't buy it.  The other thing that bothered me was why didn't the Wheatlys'  close up the house and lease it before they left.

"First of all I hate it when a heroine is scarred during the telling of the story.  However, this is not the reason I gave this book only 3 stars.  I liked the premise of the book, as well as the strong hero and beautiful, entrepid heroine.  But though I enjoyed sections of this book other sections just bored me.  And I really disliked how his grandfather belittled the heroine and his hesitency at the end to go rescue the heroine.  Of course he did, but I'm used to a hero that rushes to the defense of the heroine, without a second thought, and that is how I like it.  That he had to be urged (by his grandfather of all people) to go save her, was a total turn-off for me.",IT WAS GOOD NOT GREAT,1363478400,3,3,3,0
"My Blurb: The rules used to be simple: bad guys broke the law and super heros kicked their asses. But that's all changed, now. When a used-to-be up-and-coming super hero returns after a mysterious twenty-year absence, he finds a world where master criminals post their fiendish plots online, heros bid for the right to oppose them, and the public follows it all in a complex Franken-merger betting scheme that is one part stock market, one part reality TV empire, and all kinds of crazy. But when Mr. Big destabilizes the entire system and threatens to bring Capital City to its knees, only our washed up used-to-be hero can save the day. If he can just convince everyone that he himself is not Mr. Big.My Review: Make yourself a score-card, you're going to need it. Everyone you are going to meet has at least two names, possibly three: hero names, alter egos, and some even lead a complex life with multiples of each. A knowledge of comic book hero lore is not required, but frankly, if you're not into DC, Marvel and the rest, you probably won't like this, either.Told in a first-person, noir style, this satirical take on pop culture moves at a frenetic pace from start to finish, with precious little down time along the way. In the end, it was a bit too frenetic for my tastes. It's trying to be too many things at once: a whimsical ""what if comic books were real"" tale, an exploration of the roots of heroism and civic responsibility, a commentary on our media-drenched culture, a broken family drama. Too many characters, too many agendas, and too many plot twists have all been crammed into a non-stop plot line, where none of the themes get enough page-time to resonate fully, which left me breathless and disoriented. It teased and tempted me a dozen different ways, but never gave enough of any one thing to satisfy me.",Rip Van Super-Winkle,1373414400,0,0,3,0

"This was an interesting take on the idea of magic. It is a book for teens, or even pre-teens that, once it gets started, makes for an entertaining read.The main issue I saw with the book is that it starts off too slowly. I don't really see any teen reader sticking with  it long enough to get to the real story, which is a shame. There are some lovely moments, and some quite original concepts in the story, which, when dealing with the idea of magic in the real world, is rather impressive. I'd expected to read something I'd already read before, but was pleasantly surprised.The characters are fun, although I don't quite understand what makes them who they are.

When you start My Soul to Take, Kaylee's stay in a psychiatric unit is alluded to but you get no details.  In My Soul to Lose, we get the rest of the story: what led to Kaylee's hospitalization and her stay in the psychiatric unit.I felt so sorry for Kaylee during this novella!  She has no idea why she sees shadows around people, feels like they are going to die, and then can't stop screaming.  Her aunt and uncle are no help and Kaylee has no one to turn to.  She meets Lydia in the psychiatric unit, but does not forge a friendship with her until the end of the book.  When Kaylee finally finds someone who might know what's going on with her, circumstances change and she is left in the dark again.I would recommend reading this before My Soul to Take.

"I'll start off by saying that all 5 of the mini-mysteries in this book were very well written.  However, I do think the title of the collection is a bit misleading, to say the least.  None of the stories were humorous, and only the first one was at all related to food.  Of the remaining 4, 3 were Westerns, starring the author's duo of Mick and Casey (apparently there are full-length books showcasing this couple).  The last story was not really a 'mystery', per se, and was much darker than the others. I was hoping that all the stories would be 'light' or 'humorous' mysteries.  They were indeed 'light' (In the best sense of the term), in that they were easy reads and there was no explicit violence, bad language, or anything that even the most prudish could take offense at (quite an accomplishment nowadays, IMO!).  My personal taste does not run to Westerns, so I was disappointed, although, as I said up front, the writing was excellent.  Just don't assume from the title that this will be a collection of 'cozy' or 'humorous' short mysteries.  If you like Westerns, then go for it, you'll enjoy these for the price.",Title is a bit misleading,1282867200,37,37,3,0

"This is a pretty decent short story and since it's free I certainly don't feel cheated out of anything, time included. I'd say it's pretty important to read the little blurb first before diving in because it doesn't really explain what's going on in the beginning and you can feel little out of the loop. The premise is pretty interesting and I like how the world is basically evolving thanks to the stupidity of man (nuclear weapons being thrown about). There were moments where I was seriously confused like the sudden introduction of religion when it's stated that no one has any anymore, it's not super religious or anything just kind of felt random.

"This is the first book I've read by this author and I can only say I hope his other books are better.  One of the main characters, Lindsay, is possibly the dumbest character I've come across.  I had zero sympathy for her.  Her kids weren't much better, but at least they weren't constantly SCREAMING at everything.  She put the lives of everyone around her in danger by inexplicably ignoring orders from the people trying to protect her.  Her character was flat, shallow and stupid.I have a question for the author though - why so many planet references for the names of these people?  Thomas MERCURY?  Kenneth MARS?  Mr. JUPITER?  I half expected for them to only drive Saturns with the theme from ""The Jetsonsblasting from the radio.The other characters in the book (Kline, Sperry, Zero, etc) just popped in randomly without any explanation and then were killed off when he didn't know what to do with them.  There were too many unbelievable ""shoot 'em up"" scenes.This book is in some dire need of editing.  I found several misspelled words, poor sentence structure, words used improperly and a lot of random awkward descriptions.  The most annoying part is that for the entire book, the goal was to find a dead woman and her child.  That was the driving force in the FBI agents (Kline) life.  The killer refused to tell where he left the bodies.  He would only give vague answers and constantly tell everyone that the bodies were in a place no-one would EVER think to look, somewhere so UNUSUAL, etc etc etc.  Then ::SPOILER ALERT:: the woman and child are found BUT IT NEVER SAYS WHERE!!!!  Where was this magical, secret spot that the entire force of the FBI couldn't find?  Why on earth was this tidbit left un-answered?!I hated the ending.

"David Gaughran's If You Go Into the Woods contains two stories, the title one and the Reset Button.  I liked the initial story, it's short (about seven minutes long) and is written Grimm's Fairytale like, in that it sets the scene but doesn't waste time getting you to know what's behind Jiri being a depressed lonely child, why he has no father, and why his mother is of the deadbeat variety, scaring her son constantly as she just sits around bursting into tears.  Gaughran could have gone into more details with the background but that would only have you left wanting more for the payoff. What was there was only there to get Jiri into the woods and explain why he feels a need to satisfy his well being by going there. With the start being left simple, the unanswered questions that the reader obviously still has in their mind after Jiri encounters what he does are acceptable to have as they fit in with the overall tone of the story.With the second story, The Reset Button, which is slightly longer, probably about a ten minute read, I found the opposite was true.  Again Gaughran only vaguely tells us what's going on, but because there's some bizarre stuff happening already such as his wife getting mad he didn't take their son to the zoo in the middle of a snowstorm, you've got too many questions from the start.  This ones basically about a guy who has lost custody of his son, rarely gets to see him and copes with it by hitting his local bar.  However he's getting frustrated that no one seems to care enough about his existence to remember what he orders, what he's told them about himself, even though he remembers everything they've told him while making conversation in the past.  The ending doesn't make a great deal of sense to me, the title of the story makes you form a theory after you've read the final sentence but there's bits in the story contradicting that being the case.  The second story was just very unsatisfactory to me.I give the title story 5 stars, the second just one, simply because it didn't make any sense to me.","Two Short Stories, First a Lot Better Than The Second",1329868800,1,1,3,0

"bodyI picked this book up as a Amazon freebie.  Now is the time to read all the holiday feel good stuff, so I thought it would be a nice change of pace.  This was a super fun, light holiday read.  The story was ""A Christmas Carol"" revisited.  Daphne dies back during Vietnam. She feels she has died to early so she bargains with an angel to be sent back.  The Angel Council agrees and send her to help Nat become a better person.  The trick is that he sends her to the future, ie. Present day.  She ends up helping the son of the man who she saved when she died.  As expected, Daphne falls in love with Nat and vice versa all the while he is changing his perception of things as they look at his past and future.  These scenes come through differing electronics, like a TV, a PC monitor, a copy machine plate...the author did a good job of incorporating the ""The Christmas Carol"" from a modern day point of view.  Nat was very damaged goods. As a child, his father ignored him and he learned better not to feel than to be hurt.  As young adult, he found that the woman he proposed to didn't really love him for him, but for his money...so from that he learned that women and men use each other, nothing more. Like the original ""Scrooge"", he thought money was the most important thing. Not family, not friends and not Christmas.  He yearly fired people on his staff at Christmas time, boy he was a downer before.  As they looked back on different parts of his life, he started to realize that he was seeing things differently than he did previously, thus changing him.  Daphne was changing him.  But Daphne's job was only temporary, she was expected to move into a new body and continue her life, with no recollection of Nat.  Us readers already know what will happen, but it was nice reading it anyways.  Just a nice feel good book. It was a little shorter than the books I am used to reading, but I felt that it was well paced and if felt like I got the full story.  On a side note, I must say the way the author spells Nat is odd to me...I'm assuming its pronounced like Nate, sine the guys name is Nathaniel.

"Between the Land and the Sea is my first mermaid book (if you're not counting The Little Mermaid picture books). Honestly, I liked it but there were a few things that didn't exactly click with me.The overall plot is interesting. I really like the concept but I wasn't totally satisfied with the execution. I'm really split in half on this. While I feel like half of it was done well, the other half left me wanting. For me, the ending was a little anti-climatic. I was expecting it all to be a much bigger deal. The author did a pretty good job at building it all up but when it came to the resolution, I felt like it wasn't big enough.The characters also left me feeling conflicted. I liked Evie and Martin (Marina's neighbor and father) but they weren't in the book that much. Cruz (the cousin) and Megan (the friend) were nice additions to the cast of characters but, again, I was left feeling split on this. While at first I really liked them, the more the book continued the more ups and downs I had. Overall, sometimes I felt connected then other times I felt disconnected. This was pretty much how I felt with just about everyone though, which is actually disappointing because I really wanted to love the characters.As for the writing, I think that was mostly the reason why I'm left still wanting. The characters' reactions weren't always believable or they felt out of place, which I think is really what kept me from liking them as much as I wanted to. I also felt like some key plot elements were revealed too easily or too soon.Marina and Ethan's romance was light-hearted and cute. I enjoyed it and I really liked Ethan most of the time. My only issues with him were that sometimes, like the others, I felt like his reactions were out of place. As for Marina, she is one tough mama. I mean, you don't usually come across female leads in books set in the real world that are so tough. But I never really felt connected to her.

"No SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 to a new para-romance from Rogers. Definitely a MUST READ for fans of her ""Red Rock Pass"" series as the characters are consistent. Focuses on basic inter-werewolf struggles- pack leadership, mating, etc- during the Great Depression, so this is BEFORE Gavin has his own pack to care for. Not too lusty, but enough to be satisfying.SETTING IS IMPORTANT- and the reason I'm giving this only 3 stars. I was confused as hell in the beginning as I didn't realize the time period in which it was set. Why on earth would the women need to bring the water for a bath??? Maybe I'm just dense and missed the obvious, but it took me a while to figure out what the heck was going on- prohibition, stock market crash, lack of jobs... and running water... and neighbors. I couldn't understand where all these farm girls could possibly have come from around Massachusetts!Aside from that, it's a sweet story. Nothing outrageous, just a little bit of fun. Violence is minimal for the genre- more implied that anything explicit. It would have been nice if it had been a little more flushed out, but it worked in the end. The ending was great. By that time I was familiar with the setting enough to properly experience what life must have been like and it is a great set up for future books.RECOMMENDATIONS: (hard to find something very similar... these have something of a similar atmosphere)1.

It is called a revolver at one point, however the character loads it with a clip (means a magazine). So, is it a revolver or a semi-auto? It reads like it is some kind of a magnum, but we are never told.  The AR-15 is shot once, then the shooter has to chamber another round? A semi-auto is autoloading.

"Time is not on Emily Fenwick's side. In fact, it may just be out to get her. One minute she's a cop with the NYPD, the next she's sucked from the present day and thrust into the midst of the Punks, a rag-tag band of time travelers who've carved out a territory they call Steamside in 1890 New York.Only it's not 1890 as it should be... not with the Hindenburg making cameo appearances over Central Park. Something's gone wrong with history and it seems to be up to the Punks of Steamside and their leader, Jack Pettigrew, to set it right.Jack Pettigrew, aka the Man, is a natural leader-brave, intelligent, practical, proud, and completely gorgeous. Everyone is in love with him, men and women alike. It's all very frustrating, but not half as frustrating as the knowledge that if they can't fix the past, there may not be a future to get back to-and where would that leave Emily?Steamside Chronicles is part of the steampunk genre-a type of speculative fiction, usually expressed as a kind of ""alternate history"" where Jules Verne-type science fiction is made factual. Ciar Cullen takes a slightly different approach. Her steampunk has more of a MacGyver quality as the Punks use 1890s technology to create a world more familiar to their modern sensibilities.I enjoyed the Neverland feel of Steamside. The Punks are delightful as reinvented Lost Boys, choosing names and roles for themselves, scrounging for flotsam and calling it treasure, and building their own patchwork paradise.I didn't feel every aspect of Steamside Chronicles was as successful. With elements of fantasy, time travel, romance, mystery and adventure all jockeying for attention, there's a lot going on here and it doesn't all gel completely. Sometimes it feels as if the story wants to go in several directions at once.The mystery and adventure are fascinating, but don't really take off until very late in the game, and the romance is charming, but sometimes feels like its competing with the plot. The publisher gives the book a ""Heat Level"" rating of 2 out of a possible 5. I think that's about right.While I can't give the book an unequivocal recommendation as either romance or speculative fiction, I applaud its ingenuity and imagination. If you're a fan of steampunk, or if you want to like steampunk and haven't yet found the right expression of it, I'd say Steamside Chronicles is definitely worth a try. It may just be the past you've been searching for.ValReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","""While I can't give the book an unequivocal recommendation as either romance or speculative fiction, I applaud its ingenuity""",1327190400,2,2,3,0

I had trouble believing part of the plot (which I won't mention here, as I don't want to spoil it for others), so that also contributed to my three-star rating.","Decent Story, But Pacing Problems and Lack of Editing Are Distracting",1312848000,0,0,3,0

"This is the first novella within the series that pulls past characters and accessories from previous novellas.  In terms of characters, Heaven on Fire revisits one of the evil demons withinDemon's Night, a Jason Dark supernatural mystery, the first book in the series.  The cross fromGhosts Templar, a Jason Dark supernatural mysteryalso plays an important role within this novella.  And, while I still stand by previous statements that Henkel's novellas are standalone productions, I think the reader will find it extremely beneficial to have read both Demon's Night and Ghosts Templar before reading this novella, especially as it glosses over some facts that readers may need in order to understand Heaven on Fire completely.While I enjoyed this novella on the whole, I wasn't as interested in the storyline as I had been with Henkel's previous work.

"This is a ten minute or so length short story with huge plot holes along the way.  The basis for the overall plot is a good one.  A stuck up woman, has been set up on a bad blind date by her roommate because she borrowed her dress. However it is never really explained why her date is so bad, other than he ordered spaghetti and has a well paid job where he works out expiration dates.  We as readers are dropped in at the end of her job where she is already planning on getting up her roommate for setting this date up.  It's hard to know straight away who you should be siding with as you begin this tale, did something actually happen earlier on the date or is Cindy just stuck up and is disappointed Bob's not a lawyer of something?  How hard would the whole date have been to add or at least a few minutes before. Surely that should have been the easiest part of the story to write, pick from millions of potential embarrassing things he could have done, habits he could have.  Anyway we're left wondering what's so bad about Bob as the date ends?  Shortly after Cindy learns some of Bob's table talk could have made her a mint if she'd bothered to pay attention, convinced she's about to learn some crucial information to make her rich she decides to give Bob a call?  What is Bob's deep dark secret?Mild Spoilers - We and Cindy learn what that is, and this new direction of the story does make the whole short story seem like it's about to become a lot more interesting but then Cindy just walks out.  Surely access to what's in Bob's workplace is a lot more interesting than him having access to confidential financial reports.  Then the whole Cindy plot ends and we have a new one for the last couple of paragraphs out of nowhere that adds nothing to the plot or is even explained how these new visitors know about what's there in the first place.It could have been a really good short story, it just had too many holes and a stupid out of nowhere ending that seemed to be there for no other point other than to have a twist in the final paragraph.","Great Idea, Huge Holes In Storyline and Why Did We Need the Ending?",1331942400,1,1,3,0

"About the book:Richie flips hamburgers for a living and even though he is a great worker, one of the best, he can't get an assistant manager position. His boss doesn't find him management material. To top it off he lives with his parents and doesn't have a girlfriend. In short, he feels like a loser.Then into his life comes Jack Fates who gives him a 'do over' because life has been unkind to Richie. Going back 10 years, he gets to try to win his sweetheart, try to beat out the bully in school, and try for college once again. The only thing he must not do is tell anyone, make a profit on his future knowledge, or interfere with anyone else's life. If he does, he will find himself right back in the future with no changes.As Richie drifts through school, he starts making small changes that end up to be big ones.  He changes his name from Richie to Rich, his eyewear from glasses to contacts, his study habit from okay to good. He asks his female friend out on a date because he wants to learn how to do it. Everything goes along well until he has to make a life or death decision, one that may forever trap him in his previous future life.My take:The plot in Do Over was well constructed though it began to feel a bit like the movie Family Man. The rules Richie had to live under for what would be ten years seemed too strict for success. He does tell one person about his step back in time and gets a warning from Jack Fates that he is flirting with being returned to his old life. But the story never makes much about this break in the rules until much later in the book. What Richie must deal with is handling others misfortunes. He is not to do anything that drastically changes the life of another but how to you stand by knowing...While the story itself was well executed, I didn't find the writing engaging or nor did I feel in touch with the characters. First, I think it is incredibly hard to write good stories, so I always marvel when someone does it perfectly and try not to be too hard when someone misses. It is too easy to say things like,"" I went to the movies with Jim. Mary came in at the last minute. She ate some of my popcorn."" instead of drawing a picture of the scene. Too much of this book is told in this fashion. Seldom does the reader get to live inside the story. For me, I would have found it more fun to be part of the action.This is a short read and I believe young people will enjoy the plot, twists and all. The dilemma is one I think anyone could enjoy.

"I recently downloaded several of Joshua Scribner's short stories, and this is the one that I was most looking forward to reading.  It started out very well, but unfortunately by the end, I was a bit confused by the direction that the plot took.The basic story is that in a maternity ward, the college student working there starts to see a mysterious little girl staring at the babies, and it scares this college student.  I can't say much more without giving the rest of the story away, but I will say that the premise was extremely intriguing.  The bad news is that by the end of the book, the story had kind of taken a turn for the worse, and the mood had strangely changed from horror to happiness.Although this was such a short story, Mr. Scribner did a very good job at developing the main character and introducing some other characters.  There wasn't a large amount of background information given, but what was there was very well told.  As for the scare factor of the book, it had potential to be really creepy, but by the end of the book, nothing was really spooky anymore.Overall, it's a decent read that takes 10 minutes or less, and I wouldn't necessarily not recommend reading it.  The ending is quite strange and confusing, and that just took away from the entire story for me, but others may like it more than I did.  I do look forward to reading Mr. Scribner's other works, because he does seem to be a very good writer.  If you were interested at all by the description of the story, go ahead and give this story a try; however, I will more than likely not be reading this short story again because it just ultimately left me underwhelmed.",Decent story,1305072000,4,4,3,0

"I downloaded this story when it was available for free, but it took me a couple months to get around to reading the story.  I was really happy with the character development of the four main characters, Sylvie (aka Iffy) the birthday clown and female lead, Nick the single father trying to do what's best for his girls, Lana the daughter stressed beyond her seven years, and Emily the fireball of a five year old.  The children's characters were excellently written, and by far my favorite part of this book.  They were so complex, and really came to life.  I also loved the backstory about their mother who was the ex. wife before she died.  There's plenty of stories about widowers, and plenty of stories about divorced single dads, but this story combined several unique elements.  I think I could have enjoyed a much longer story involving the children and dealing with everything with this divorce then death.The romance side of the story reminded me as what are sometimes categorized as ""retro"" romances.  It contained some of the traditional romance plot elements, such as a very wealthy man who is able to financially provide for the poor woman, and the couple going from strangers to HEA after only a handful of encounters.There are also some editing issues, a few typos and misplaced or wrongly used words.  It didn't bother me that much, but I know some people find it takes them out of the reading experience.  If you're a reader easily distracted when a novel needs editing, you might want to pass on this one.If you enjoy the ""retro"" romance novels, then I think you'll really enjoy this book.  I enjoyed many aspects of the book, but I prefer the more modern style contemporary romances over the traditional style.","Overall 3 stars, though some aspects rank higher",1332979200,2,2,3,0
"First off, let me say that I didn't get the title of this book. What did you hear him exclaim? Who are you? And who is him? Does that have anything to do with the story? (My confusion didn't affect my rating, of course. I'm just curious.)Steve Adams has always loved Christmas and dressing up as Santa to spread the merriment around, but he isn't in the mood to celebrate the holidays this year. He can't fill out his Santa suit anymore, thanks to the new lifestyle he's been forced to embrace after the scare he had almost a year ago, when he had to have an angioplasty and doctors put a stent in his heart. Ordered to clean up his act, he quit smoking, dropped a lot of weight, and started exercising regularly and eat healthy. He's on his way to Vegas, to spend the holidays and avoid the Christmas festivities he'd have to join if he stayed at home, when he meets a somewhat distraught younger (and attractive) man and his 5-year-old niece.Chandler Tracey and his niece Poppy, whose guardianship he inherited after his brother and sister-in-law were killed in a car accident only a month ago, are on their way to spend Christmas at his parents' when car trouble leaves them stranded on the road. Being a nice guy and all, Steve offers them a ride and the trio is soon back on the road. As Steve and Chandler spend time together and talk about their recent life-changing experiences, the sexual attraction between them grows and they begin to wonder if there's more to it. Well, duh! :)I thought this was a very sweet Christmasy story, but it was also very unrealistic and I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy it without frowning over Chandler's and Steve's foolishly trusting behavior. Chandler was neurotic about Poppy's safety, which was okay considering he was as insecure as only new parents can be, so how come he didn't think twice before accepting Steve's ride offer? Steve was a complete strange and you just don't climb into a strange's car like that, especially when there's a safe alternative available. Steve's safety wasn't in any danger when he offered Chandler and Poppy a ride, but I thought he pushed his luck when he invited them to stay at his house. On his defense, he knew Chandler better by then, but still.All in all, this was an okay read, with some quirky but likable characters and a good amount of holiday cheer. There wasn't much conflict in the story, but that was fine because I wasn't expecting it. The HEA felt a bit forced at first, but a nice epilogue cemented it and made it okay. After all, all's well that ends well.",Very sweet... and very unrealistic.,1298332800,1,1,3,0

It was just...something.While the author believes he may have had an encounter with God, and who am I to discount that opinion, it wasn't a very good job of relating it back for the common man like myself to understand the point the author stated so many times he was trying to relate.  There are many stories out there about people's encounters with God (such as90 Minutes in Heaven: My True Story), and I suggest you pass this one up to read one of those.

"It's been a while since I've read a book about witches. At first I thought, after reading the blurb and the title, that this book would be about real demons in human form. After reading it, it turned out that the cheerleaders are just ""ordinary"" witches. I was slightly disappointed, cause I was looking forward to read something about demons. The story would have been so more interesting! Not that it wasn't a nice read, but witches are kinda standard material in YA these days and demons are not (haven't seen them that much or am I wrong? )At first I sympathized a lot with Harper, since she was innocent most of the times, cause she couldn't control her powers. After she suffers from a combination of the flu and a magic spell, she starts to forget things and I started to feel a little annoyed. Okay, I know she couldn't do a thing about the magic spell, but the author had written it in such a way that it wasn't credible to me. To me it felt like she wasn't trying her best to break the spell, while the author probably  envisioned a much more powerful spell...The ending of the book was a complete surprise for me! From the beginning I had one suspect in mind for the death of the girl, but it wasn't that person at all! Also it was hard to form an opinion if the ""witches"" were good or evil, since every time that I had one, they did something to turn it completely around.My overall rating of this book was 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.

"This is one of Greene's earliest works, originally published under pseudonym Jeanne Grant. Lacks a little polish, but contains all the Greene elements we love.The leads are likeable, their professions different enough to add flavor, and the two disparate settings interesting. I like that the heroine's fertility issue wasn't one that would magically reverse itself with true love, as happens in so many romances. Although their speech patterns didn't ring true for me, the behaviour of the four year old twins did. They would be acting out in bewilderment and grief one moment, and distracted and having fun the next. I found it age appropriate. And they got all the best lines in the book. (The scene in the bathtub of one boy dissing the other was a favorite). What was supposed to be the usual Category Conflict Climax in the story was created solely by female angst - a plot point I despise - but was resolved almost immediately.Good, quick read.",Good Read,1311379200,0,0,3,0

"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.I won't lie, I asked to be a reviewer based on the name of this book alone - it made me giggle! The short stories in this book are amusing, yet sometimes very confusing. Ms. Tyrpak's foray back into the dating scene after her husband tells her that their marriage is over due to a part of her anatomy - I swear I spit sweet tea reading that - and consequent divorce made me glad that my own marriage is secure and in no jeopardy of breaking up.I didn't really see all of the stories as being stories, some of them read more like essays. The Christmas one - I think it's the third - had me laughing so hard I cried. But there's one towards the end that is so out of place, it just doesn't belong. Although, to be honest, I wanted to keep reading and find out who the people were and what their story was.I definitely recommend this book if you're having a bad day and want a good laugh.

"Dan can't wait to leave his office and head for the gym. He's comfortable around other guys and just enjoys a workout - until the day a professional bodybuilder shows up with a deep voice and a body to die for! But at forty, Dan can't see why a man in his late twenties would be interested.According to a magazine article, the handsome Gene is gay, out and articulate. Next time at the gym Dan and Gene spot for each other on weight exercises. Gene recruits for technology positions so he and the older computer programmer have common ground - although they never talk about it! They get on well and Gene asks Dan out to dinner. But the man who dumped Dan nine months previously turns up again after being dumped by his new boyfriend, and asks to come back into Dan's life. Now what?Gay people have relationship dilemmas just the same as straight people, and Dan's self-consciousness could apply to any person at any age. Luckily Dan has good friends. Gene is tired of dating men who are well-built but have no intellect, but they don't all like being told it's over....I enjoyed reading about the food eaten by these two health-conscious men - duck and poached pear salad, roast duck with raspberry sauce, chicken with herbs and wild rice. The regular weightlifting workouts described will surely enhance this book for gym fans and may spur them on to achieve success.

"The Dream Crystal is the first in the new series, The Dream Wars, by Mark O'Bannon.  The book opens with Aisling at a pivotal point in her life, having just lost her dream of becoming a fashion designer.  She has just days to move out of her family's home after a lifetime of feeling as if she were an outsider.  After an incident that even she herself doesn't understand, she is asked to leave her beloved Kung Fu temple.  And she is suddenly having visions of people in the shadows, watching her.  Things seem to be on a downward spiral when her best friend is whisked from her side and disappears.  Soon, Aisling and Genevieve are transported to a world that they never dreamed existed, the Land of Dreams.  When Aisling learns that she is a faery changeling, as many questions arise as are answered.I really loved the premise of this book.  Changelings are generally dismissed by the ""true"" faeries of the land, as they tend to survive a very short time in the Land of Dreams.  Having lived mortal lives, many have lost their ability to truly dream and to believe in magic and they quickly fall into the shadows.  But is soon obvious that there is something different about Aisling as she is cast in the role of heroine.  The Land of Dreams is at war with the Land of Shadows, and Aisling is dropped in the middle of it.  Those living in the Land of Dreams believe that dreams fuel the magic but that too much pride will cause your downfall and send you into the shadows.  More and more faeries are falling to the shadows of Lord Ith and Queen Annan is trying to find a way to make that stop.  On the surface, it seems to be a classic ""good vs. evil"" tale.  But I loved that it wasn't that simple.  There were times when it was just impossible to really know which side to root for!!  The story was also as much a reflection of Aisling's journey to redefine herself and find her purpose in life as it is an epic fantasy tale.  She is a fabulous character and really draws you into the story.  Constantly cast into impossible situations, it was very easy to be right there next to her in the story.  She was made all the more believable because she didn't always make the perfect choices in those situations.The writing truly brought you into the story, a beautiful mix of reality and fantasy.  I loved the blend of Irish and Asian cultures as well.  My only complaint would be that there was almost too much fashion commentary.  While I understand that it tied in Aisling's fashion design dreams, there were times that it stalled the flow of the book for me.  Every outfit was described in detail in every scene.  While those descriptions themselves were well-written and definately gave me a perfect image, it could get distracting.  After a bit, I tended to skim those parts before getting back to the meat of the story.  Otherwise, I loved the flow of the story.  It was action-packed and the gray areas between good and evil kept me turning the pages, wanting to know what would happen next.The characters in this story were fantastic, both main and otherwise.  Genevieve, as a mortal, added a lot of humor to the story and I loved the interaction between her and Eileen, Aisling's guardian.  Queen Annan was also an interesting character, one I never quite figured out.  I liked that the author created the characters to be entirely relatable as people, despite the fact that they were faeries.  Very often, fantasy characters may be perfectly likeable, but not relatable to mere mortals.  These characters were generally everyday people who just happened to be faeries.  That was very refreshing.The cover is a pretty one, but it led me to think that this would be a somewhat steamy novel at times.  It truly was not.  In fact, the romance level was quite low, the focus being more on Aisling and her quests throughout the story.  It was a fun read and I will definately be picking up the next book, The Dark Mirrors of Heaven, when it comes out.  If you love Irish mythology and fae stories, I recommend picking this up and reading it!  I gave it a 3.5 mugs, but that was solely due to the fashion commentary note I mentioned above.  The story itself is a very good one!",A world without dreams?,1314835200,0,0,3,0

"I picked up this novella during a free promotion.  I was curious to see how the novella was presented because it is being advertised as an introduction to the novel that will be published in the Spring of 2011.The story opens up with a powerful scene seen through 10-year-old Lucia's eyes.  Her mother has just given birth to a son, but the child is no ordinary child.  This child, Caio, is the long-awaited savior, ""Haissem,"" for the people of Rezzia.  While her father presents the child to the faithful, Lucia is first overjoyed, but when she tries to join them on the balcony, her father pushes her aside and the cold reality of his rejection hits her hard.  Compounding the sting of rejection, Lucia witnesses a terrifying event involving her mother.  When she calls out to her father for help, he continues to ignore her and an event that will change Lucia forever plays out.  In this short scene, the author paints a vivid picture of the turmoil and suffering that Lucia endures - her conflicting feelings for her brother and her heartache over her father's rejection - and I was a little disappointed when the next chapter unfolded 19 years later.The rest of the novella is Caio's story from his ascension to the ""Dux Spiritus"" to his taking over as commander of the Rezzia army in their battle against their mortal enemies, the Pawelons.  We are introduced to his personal guard, Ilario, who secretly loves Lucia, but their difference in class makes a union between them impossible.  This surprised me because there is no back-story to let the reader know this fact so the full impact of their forbidden love is lost.  However, the author unfolds a masterful story of Caio's hopes, dreams and his own inner demons about living up to his own legend and doing the right thing.Mr. Siregar has given us a taste of the epic novel to come with this novella.  If you want to read a talented new author with a flair for storytelling, you should definitely pick up this story.

Because everything in the story was complex and at the same time rushed to make sure it stayed short, this download ended up looking underdeveloped and confusing.It's really hard to give a summary of the plot without giving anything away, but the basic idea is that while a man name Tony is enjoying a night with his friends, he is thrown into another very dangerous world.  He must figure out how to survive in this new world, while also seeing if there is a possible way of getting back to his normal life.This definitely could be classified as a sci-fi plot, and it really does have quite a decent premise.  However, the pace of the story was just too fast for any of the details to be thorough, and the reader will probably get lost halfway through.  Also, the ending was particularly disappointing; although I won't say anything else in order to prevent spoilers.Overall, the story had a bunch of potential and promise, but it was just underexplained due to the much-too-fast pacing.  The story isn't terrible; there are a few redeeming qualities such as the good characterization or the fantastic use of suspense, but the confusing elements and bad ending are enough for me to not really recommend this story.

"Ghost Hunter's leading lady Ashley is a psychic who sees ghosts, and has suffered for it throughout her life.  When Ashley inherits a pub in England just as she's trying to make a new start after ending an unfortunate engagement, she forgets her rule of avoiding historical buildings and moves across the ocean - only to find that her new home is a moldering old relic complete with a whole cast of housemates no longer among the living.  And if that isn't enough of a nightmare for Ashley, she can't seem to rid herself of a gorgeous, but irritating and somewhat stalker-y living stranger, Cristin, who first tries to get Ashley out of her new home and when that doesn't work, manages to insinuate himself in it.Cristin is a ghost hunting warrior on a dangerous mission, one that involves Ashley and her haunted house. Ashley is supposed to be Cristin's fated partner and Cristin needs her talents to succeed with his deadly task. But when Cristin meets Ashley, he quickly decides that she is just too trusting and nave to be of use to him and he is convinced that he has to get her to pack up and head back to the States - for her own good.  But even as he tries to push Ashley away, Cristin finds himself unable to keep from acting on his forbidden attraction to her and as annoying as Ashley finds Cristin, Ashley just can't keep from melting whenever she finds herself in his arms, even when his agenda puts them at odds.I had a hard time warming up to both of the leads.  And to be honest, the romance between Cristin and Ashley's was not my favorite part of the book. For the much of the story the pair have a mostly adversarial relationship punctuated by brief bouts of lustous interruptus and Cristin, even with his Scottish brogue and cool secret, never won me over. It didn't help that Ashley's interractions with Cristin (and with a child ghost who resides in her home) don't bring out the best in Ashley. However, later in the story Ashley develops relationships with several interesting supporting characters were a lot more fun and definitely upped Ashley's appeal.I loved Ashley's interactions with the upbeat and energetic witch Camile, Ashley's first friend ever, who not only accepts Ashley's `weirdness' but sees it as common ground. Together they get into a fair amount of trouble with the mysterious Devon, who both benefits and suffers from the fallout of a misfired spell by Ashley and Camile, as Ashley tries to get to the truth about Cristin, her missing father, vanishing ghosts and something dreadful that's living in the basement. It is Devon out of all of the characters in the book who was my favorite and I was definitely `team Devon' - he and Camile earned the book an extra half star - and I wished for a different ending for Devon.Ghost Hunter has a little bit of everything paranormal: psychics, angels, ghosts, witches, vampires, werewolves, leprechauns, and the haunted pub of doom.  After finishing the story I was not sure if it was a standalone. Brighton does plan on revisiting this world, but if you are looking for more of Brighton's writing in the mean time, I noticed that she has also written several historical romances.(This review is for the smashwords ebook of Ghost Hunter which I received for free.)",Ghost Hunter vs. Ghost Whisperer,1287446400,0,0,3,0

"Marina's slowly coming to terms with her family's secrets when another huge secret is revealed. Feeling betrayed from multiple angles, Marina seeks comfort in surfing with Lorelei. This brings its own dangers, and when an enemy finds them, Marina must try to save herself and her mermaid family.Following the first book, I was slightly disappointed in this one. The storyline was great, with lots of action, but it was definitely aimed at a teenaged girl audience, and not just YA lovers in general. I found the teenage drama to be overwhelming and annoying.Marina and Ethan swung from overly sweet continuous makeout sessions to full out ignoring each other break-ups. The teenaged drama of ""I love you"" turning to ""I hate you"" over the slightest small misunderstanding was annoying and frustrating. Very realistic, but not very satisfying to read.While the drama was never ending, I did find that portayal of a teen caught between being an adult and a child was very realistic and well done. Marina had some profound insights into the people around her, which helped to offset the selfishness and self-centeredness her actions often portrayed.Overall, this was a good follow-up book, however it was a little heavy on teenaged drama for me. I've never been one for drama, and I have a hard time enjoying it while reading. The story itself is good, still very original and fresh. I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoy angst in their stories.",Full of teenaged drama,1316131200,1,1,3,0

"Let us just say that it is a good thing I had read book number two - or is it book number one if you do not count the prequel, I always get confused when authors do this - or I would have never continued with this series.The Abandoned comes across more of an outline for a book then an actually novel, with no real catch or lure.Ree Hutchins is a graduate student working in a psychiatric hospital on the evening of the death of Violet Tisdal, one of their longest residing patients. Ree is curious about this woman and on the chance of returning files to the ""dungeon"", Ree snoops out her patient's records only to be attacked by an unknown assailant, a person who is determined to keep Violet's past a secret.Being a paranormal novel, you know that the spooky factor has to come in to play, so one evening Ree finds herself half-undressed in a cemetery in front of Hayden, a moonlighting ghost hunter. She has no idea how she got there, but was it possible that the spirit of Violet or Ilsa, Violet's mother, entered her and was now using Ree to exact revenge.See how convoluted this tale is? The storylines are not developed and you are left wondering, ""what am I missing, what am I not being told about the past"". Sudden character comments are made and you find yourself going back a couple of pages, trying to figure out what you missed only to realize that it was never there in the first place.My advice, skip this book and start with The Restorer you will like that installment much better.",Not Necessary,1322179200,1,1,3,0

"Finally! The book we've all been waiting for! Zoe King, the sister of current alpha of the pride.Similar to Mara (heroine of the third book in the series - Serengeti Lightning), Zoe wants to get out of town and find an eligible man as all the good ones are taken up or are too scared to approach her since she's the alpha's sister. Her intended triumphant departure was stalled (literally) when her vehicle breaks down and further obstacles are thrown in her path by the form of hot mechanic, Tyler Minor.Hmm... I think whether you would like or love this book would depend on your personal taste and style. The writing style in this book is certainly different from her previous books. There's also a slight change in the focus in the plot, with more action and a little bit of mystery, but less focus on the emotions of the characters. Perhaps this change was made since Zoe's plot was sounding dangerously similar to Mara's. It would have been interesting if Zoe had managed to run into another pride and meet someone from there. The pairing didn't resonate as well as the couples in the other books. It felt like, okay, we did the nasty, our lions are attrached, we are stuck with each other. Poor hero is stuck with another commitment which he didn't want.I far like her writing style in the previous books in the series likeSerengeti Lightning: Serengeti Shifters, Book 3When I say writing style, I don't mean the amount of passionate scenes, rather, it's the way she describes things, lays out the scene, and how she unfolds the plot. Unlike her pervious books, this book didn't reel me in. I just trudged through patiently, waiting for things to pick up and dutifully finished the book (after all, I had already read the whole of the series, so would like to know how things pan out). this book is okay.

I expected this prequel to be a stand alone story which would lead into the series - but this did not read like a stand alone tale.It was well written.

"I rated this book 3 of 5 stars.  The book was enjoyable, set in 1800's England. This book featured Alicia Woodley, who considered herself the ""poor relation"" who didn't deserve much.  Alicia had been pretty much run over by her cruel family, and she yet she still loved them all.  Nicholas Buchanan, the Duke of Dorchester, meets Alicia and decides that she is a challenge he wants to undertake.  He wants to bed her and show her her worth.  Nicholas didn't count on finding himself genuinely caring about Alicia.  Nicholas finds himself not only trying to woo Alicia, but having to protect her and uncover secrets the Woodley's are hiding.The storyline of this book was nice.  It was a pretty fun book to read, and held my interest.  The book was not stellar or fantastic, or particularly memorable.  There were only small issues with the book, mainly (in my opinion) with some of the vernacular.  It seemed that the vernacular would change a bit, from modern to 1800's, it wasn't always consistent.  It wasn't such a big deal, but I did notice it.  I enjoyed the main characters, and the love of animals.  The scene of a stud farm in the 1800's was different, and made for a good story.While the story was not fantastic, it was good.  I enjoyed reading the book, it kept my attention, and I will read more work by this author.",enjoyable regency england book,1302480000,0,0,3,0

"I think there's going to be a split in reviews for this series...those who like the idea of an uncontrolled, chaotic journey, and those who need a more defined, or linear storyline. This series is a roller coaster in the dark, you'll never see the turns and loops coming but you'll certainly feel them if you can stay with the ride long enough.I can't give you a similar reference for the story...i've never read one as unpredictable and chaotic as this one. Somewhere halfway through the second book i found the elusive lines that hold it all together, the unseen spine that aligns and becomes the  pattern for this series...A quest, where the main character is joined by others in similar situations all with the one goal of getting home only to find that along the way is where the story happens and diversions become increasingly important, frustrating the effort of going home....an apt analogy of real life...Not a book i think for light readers, but for those who go deep and enjoy long stories it should satisfy. Every book could have been done better, the technology in SciFi books is usually explainable even if in fictional ways, but here there is much that never gets explained, it's vague even to the characters most times, but i didn't find it onerous or that it detracts from the story.I've made my way through the second book and have not started the third...the first and second book were set in very different surroundings, and the third book looks to be yet another world to explore...a good thing.","SciFi on acid...a strange, long trip...but at its core, enthralling.",1350691200,2,2,3,0

"A cynical journalist (Alex Berenson) spends an uneventful time embedded with US soldiers in Senjaray in Kandahar Province. He talks to the soldiers there about dealing with a baffling local culture, narrowly avoiding IEDs, and surviving an ambush which killed several of their company. Along the way, Berenson explains Army organization (from the fire team up to Gen. Petraeus) and details the costs of the war, finally concluding that the US effort is a quagmire with little or no positive lasting impact. My favorite part of the work was his description of Kandahar Airfield, an oasis of Western civilization and a babel of coalition forces.The author did a good job mixing big picture facts with the granular experience of those on the ground, but the style was too flippant at times and his pronouncements on difficult issues were too facile. Ultimately, it came across as a somewhat glib recasting of potentially compelling source material.",A snapshot of the War in Afghanistan,1300233600,103,103,3,0

"(I received a complimentary copy of this book from Bookrooster, for this review) This is a book I ummed and ahhed about, it was like a ship caught between the shore, the reef and the open seas. It was as if the author had sailed into the wrong waters. It wasn't the writing, that was alright barring the fact some of the narrative could have been a little more genuine (write what you know about is sometimes fair advice). The story is a mystery but wanders into the realms of a romance with steamy scenes, then to crime, it was as if the author hadn't resigned herself to the genre she has picked...or perhaps is still searching for the one she will be best at. I think a good romantic story with some spicy elements would be just right. As it is the book leaves the reader a little confused as it flits from one thing to the other and the story suffers, which makes it seem mediocre at times. Candi and Lukes storyline could have been a book on it's own without confusing the issue with Jolenes troubles. I think this author has a good book in her...she just hasn't picked the right genre...yet.

"Elysia and Darien live in a world where modern society has completely collapsed, and they share a secret.  Each is called by an animal spirit to help guide mankind into a new way of living.  Will they join in this new society, or try to survive on their own?This novella is a prequel to a trilogy of the same subject matter, so it is intended to be merely an introduction to the characters and situation, and that is exactly how I saw it.  It was but a taste of what was to come, to allow readers to determine if this series would be for them.  While we do not learn enough about Elysia and Darien to make a deep connection to them, we do make some connection, enough to push us on to read the trilogy.I personally am not a huge fan of post apocalyptic literature, so for me, that was where more of the problem with the book lies.  Similarly, the whole animal spirit aspect does not particularly interest me.  I think people who are very interested in Native American religion and philosophy will be quite interested in this book, but for me, a person begin guided by a squirrel is more than a little corny.That being said, I do think the novella was well written, and worth reading.  For those who read the novella and like it, I think the trilogy will be a good match.","Not bad, just not for me.",1291075200,1,1,3,0

He is thrown to the lions and he catches the attention of Blaine and Luther, who soon sees him as a potential mate. They want to protect him, but they end up mothering in, making him unhappy. The story is about finding the only way to be happy together.The setting is interesting, but not sufficiently sketched. There's nothing making the world unclear, but I wish I knew more about the way lion shifters are perceived and interact in the world. Arslan, their leader, seems the only one to have a good experience with humans. Both Blaine and Luther depend on his teachings and follow what he says to the letter. The conversation between the lions and Marrick's family was funny and it gave an idea of the distance between the world of the lions and that of the humans.Marrick seemed more grown-up than the lions. I think it depends on his childhood. The lions are adorable and perceptive, but it was like watching two guys who are not used to thinking for themselves, they seemed more overgrown puppies than the kings of the animal world, if you get what I mean.

"This novella is very short and appears to be the beginning of a longer piece of work currently being written. It read like an introduction to a story and a rather large cast of characters and didn't turn out to be very satisfying all on its own and it ended extremely abruptly.  The prose is often beautifully written and almost has a dream-like feel to it which I loved and I see a lot of promise here with a little tweaking and expansion, especially when it comes to the characters and their plight.  The bones of the story are solid but it jumps around too quickly to get to know any of the characters on more than a surface level and it left me confused far too often for my liking.  The chapters are super short and just when I was getting into a characters point of view the story shifted to one of the many other characters.  Basically, there was too much going on for me to keep up and it was difficult to root for anyone because I didn't get to spend enough time with them to feel much of anything at all. Terrible things happen but most of it occurs off-screen and the reader is left with only the surface aftermath.  I'm the type of reader who prefers to be in on the action, experiencing the emotions along with the characters, no matter how horrifying they may be.  I just felt left out here and longing for more.Basically the story is about the inhabitants of Scarlock who are firmly under the thumb of a greedy money lender named Copeland. Nereia became a thief when her parents died and Copeland took possession of everything they owned.  Her only other option was to become a prostitute.  Either way, nearly everything she owns is tithed to Copeland and he keeps increasing the tithe.  Nereia fears that now that her younger sister Mary is old enough, she will be forced into prostitution.  Nereia will do most anything to save her innocent sister and Copeland uses that fact against her and a gritty adventure ensues when Nereia rebels.  Many other characters are introduced, many are interesting enough but as I said the focus is just too scattered to become fully invested in any of them.

"I read all of the books in this series and I adore the family very much. I couldn't wait to read this one as well. Honestly, it was a good book, but I just didn't feel it was as strong as the others. The supernatural aspect feels out of place in the series and honestly feels like a badly written plot device without much of it adding to the actual point of the story, which is Lady Elizabeth and Michael falling in love while staying away from society. Ms. Knight-Catania had the elements set in place for a sweetly romantic love story where Lady Elizabeth tries to get over her feelings of loneliness and forced separation from her family while also dealing with her anger and betrayal with the twins' deception and eventually finding it within herself to forgive the cruel trick they had played on her. But the supernatural aspect forced everything else that would have made the story great to the side as she tries to battle with a ghost that no one else really believes exists, which might have  been a great plot device if the authoress had focused more on how Michael didn't believe her and then eventually saw that it mattered to Elizabeth greatly, whether he believed her or not. I feel they only barely scraped this plot and then the book ended on such an abrupt note. I felt certain for days that somehow the download was incomplete and I kept downloading and re-downloading the book in an attempt to get the missing pages I was sure had to be there. I've finally accepted that it really does end so abruptly, which no real satisfying conclusion to the only plot device they gave any credence to.

"I realy cannot agree with all these 5 star ratings. The book is ok, the characters have potential. I liked them more towards the end than the beginning so I think character developemnet  is essential if this plans to be a series. As for the protagonist Ms Dodd, I find myself at times relating, but more often than not I would like to strangle her. The self doubt bit is tedious and time consuming. You cannot prove to us she is a confident go getter by simply writing it.As comparing her to The Stephanie Plum series by Ms Evanovich is insulting to Ms E. This series does not grab you and run like the other, but it has the potential of improvement so I gave it a 3. It was an ok read. And don't bother trying to figure out who done it...there are no clues that will lead you to it...oh excuse me there was one obscure clue...a word. As to why the spa chick had to be in the gather them all together and reveal moment???? What can I say I gave it a 3 because it is 98 degees at the top of the mountain today and it was a cheap order on the kindle...so it killed a few hours....but the writing is often stilted, the characters are pretty one dimensional.

Also, there were times when whole words were missing from sentences, but you got used to it by the end and just filled them in automatically.

"Okay, I realize that what turned me off this book is extremely subjective, all reviews are subjective, but I think some points are less subjective than others, however this is how I feel in good faith.Everybody has a different suspension of disbelief threshhold and believe in fantasy I can suspend disbelief as to a lot of things. Unfortunately I wanted to roll my eyes once I realized that yes, blurb was actually correct. And yes, I bought it because I was curious enough to see if I can suspend disbelief. So I cannot blame anybody but myselfSo, no spoilers, since  all I reference is the blurb which is here is for everybody to see, but seriously, Ryland dear, the only way you can get money for your tuition is to agree to be thrown to werelions? I mean, seriously, honestly, fantasy is great, but author chose to write about very human educational institution, right? Um, go get a loan, go work in construction on weekends, go do something. Sorry, I want realistic interactions even in fantasy, I cannot tolerate much stupidity.Anyway, if you CAN suspend disbelief and just tell yourself that this is what author chose to do to throw leads together, the story is actually well written and hot in my opinion and this is is why I give it three stars and not one. I just wish that initial setup would have worked better for me, even if he would have decided to do so for fun, because he was bored, that would have still been more believable for me, but not because he felt he had no other choice and nowhere else to get money.

"""The Secret Apocalypse"" is a fast and entertaining read. This story is told through the eyes of a sixteen year old high-school girl; she is the sole survivor of the ""Oz Virus"" - a military weapons test that goes awry. The virus has mutated and and the vaccine is no longer effective. Ground zero can't be quarantined - the virus is spreading too fast via blood and saliva and troops are quickly overwhelmed by the attacking hoards of zombies. The military goes to great length to contain this epidemic and reverts to blowing up bridges and other escape routes to create a controlled quarantine area, unfortunately, thousands of survivors are killed as collateral damage in the process.There is no stopping the virus and the military is desperate, unleashing jets, helicopters, napalm and nukes to kill zombies and survivors alike.  Government killer teams are dispatched throughout the country in search of survivors that may have come in contact with the virus but haven't turned yet - they are rescued then taken to secret centers, unknowing that they will soon be dissected and become ""specimens"" in the experiments to develop a vaccine.Rebecca and her friends are in the middle of all this and must evade both zombies and soldiers in their quest for survival and to escape the country. There are many twists and turns along the way, plenty of places to bite your fingernails or hold your breath. Rebecca appears to be the ""sole"" survivor from the apocalypse in Australia, the virus claiming the remaining 22 million citizens. We'll have to read the next book in the series to find out what happened to her friends...they all split apart before her rescue.  Are they all dead?I liked the story a lot and would recommend it to others, but must also agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of editing within the story...at times, it is distracting. If the book were ""fixed"", I would most likely give it four or five stars. This book also includes an excerpt of the next book which sheds some light upon the earlier question - I will most likely purchase it to see how this story progresses.John Podlaski, authorCherries - A Vietnam War Novel",Entertaining read,1376006400,0,0,3,0

"Detective Preston Andrews and his partner Trace Evans have just been called to the scene of an early morning murder. Andrews recognizes the victim as a friend of his younger sister and begins on the mission to find her killer. The trail soon leads them into an even bigger case involving multiple kidnappings of young women which is already being worked by the FBI. Special Agents Rachel Wilding and Bob Forrester from the agency's DC office join the investigation.For those who like to puzzle out clues along with the detectives, this book is short on details to help the reader along to connect the dots. In fact, many conclusions seem to have been jumped by the investigators, especially from the FBI, without giving the reader any background on how these suspicions were justified. How were the various disappearances of young women across the country related? How was it determined that they were all part of the same plot? None of this is explained even in passing, only that the information withheld because of ""security"" even from the local police as well as the reader. Too many plot holes go unfilled, making the results of the mystery unsatisfying to the reader who wants more. Even the time and place of the murder does not make sense when it is revealed who was responsible for the crime and why.The first part of the book sets up the fairly new partnership of the experienced Det. Andrews and young Trace Evans, and they begin to work the case together, but somewhere along the way Trace disappears entirely and is not included in the later investigative events or arrests. The same fate occurs to one of the two FBI investigators, Forrester; he comes to town a second time, then he isn't part of the action. Add to that the unrealistic and unprofessional behavior of the other agent, and you've got a mystery that is quickly turning into a romantic romp.There are also holes in the research done by the author. The geography and place names in Virginia Beach and Norfolk are often inaccurate. Other things such as the references to DAs and ADAs are also incorrect. Virginia does not have district attorneys, it has Commonwealth's Attorneys instead. FBI agents working in DC would be aware of this fact, especially one who went to law school in Virginia. The local police, of course, would also know better.The book started off as promising a new, interesting pair of detectives to launch a series of engaging mysteries, but ended up with an uneven, poorly plotted story instead.Not recommended.","A Quick, Unsatisfying Mystery",1400889600,0,0,3,0

"FBI Special Agent Alex Ware and his partner, Special Agent Shawn Matthews are in deep trouble. Deep undercover to try to nail a particularly offensive weapons trafficker who doesn't trust nor do business with sexually straight people, they're forced into an intimacy that Alex hadn't anticipated - but what really makes him worry is just how much he enjoys the six month deep cover operation. What shocks him is when his Aussie partner and friend, Matthews, comes clean on both his bi-sexuality AND his interest in Alex. An interest that supersedes any work-related cover op.And from that point on, Alex's life - as neurotic and repressed as it was - turns on its ear and becomes uncomfortable, uncertain, and wracked with yearning. In short, utterly unrecognizable.Shawn is adorable in his open devotion to Alex, and Alex is quirky and frustrating in turns as he struggles with his fear and sexual confusion. As a character driven cop thriller, their relationship is the best part of Matter of Necessity.It's a solid short story, but it could have been truly great had there been more depth and detail given on their undercover assignment and fleshed out to a full length novel. The glossed-over introduction to the thug they're trying to bring down lessened the tension of the cop thriller aspect of the story. I also would've liked a bit more detail on the physical aspect of Shawn and Alex's relationship.",Fun and Endearing,1253059200,1,1,3,0

"While I did enjoy Breathless, it wasn't the best read ever. It seemed interesting, and normally I'd sample it but since it's only .99 cents I bought it. I enjoy books with more dialouge, rather than paragraphs of what's going on and describing a person.A mysterious boy shows up at school one day, and is immediately smitten with Lia. As is, Lia with the mysterious boy. I found it uneasy. He kept popping up being mysterious. In my opinion, a little TOO mysterious. It seemed creepy. If I would have been Lia, I would have felt uneasy about him even if he was beautiful.You knew he was something different, because every time he entered the room Lia felt a chill. I think what the book had going for itself was the fact that nothing was revealed too soon. It left me wanting. I wanted to know what Chaseyn was. And even at one point, I thought maybe he was just a normal guy. You do eventually learn what the cruse is about, and it's quite interesting.One thing I found refreshing was her fear of him. It seems every book the damsel is totally inlove and doesn't care what supernatural being he is. Lia was afraid of Chaseyn when she came to realize what he is. She always loved him, but for a moment or so..she feared him.While it's not one of my favorite books I've read, it's well written, and an interesting story. I will most likely read the next book, if I remember. I'm also one who has to know how it ends.One thing that rubbed me the wrong way, was the words used. It's being told from a teenagers point of view. Some of the words I felt were out of place...calling her bracelet a token. I don't know any teen who would describe a gift as a token.There was also a slight mistake. It seems you don't learn his name until he gives her a note, but she refers to his jacket as Chaseyn's jacket before the note was given to her. Nothing major.",Breathless.,1294099200,11,11,3,0

They have a routine questioning of a few suspects and solve the crime without any twists or surprises for the reader.  However, the thoroughness of the investigators lends credibility that the author could carry a full novel length premise and do more justice to building suspense and mystery to it.Fairly well edited.

"This book had an overall good storyline, but the story was just lacking. The first half of the book was spent on Valerie's upcoming journey to Pompeii with her family and then the actual voyage itself, so while it held the reader captive somewhat, you were really waiting for her to hurry up get there so the story of her journey through the mists of time would happen.  With the first half focused on the journey to Pompeii, the second half of the book flies too fast. However, it was very interesting to read about the Pompeii culture and what life would've been like back then. The love story was somewhat lacking, in my opinion. It seemed that Valerie was always staying away from Christos and when they were together there were no deep meaningful conversations that helped you to understand what exactly they were feeling. It seemed one minute they were at each other's throats and then the next they were declaring their undying love and devotion for one another.

"~3.8 stars~Most of my absolute favorite books are YA, and a lot of them are lgbt. I have read and discovered some pretty amazing authors and writing. So any YA book I read, I end up comparing and rating to the best YA I've read (Suicide Watch by Kelly York, Gives Light by Rose Cristo, Collide by J.R. Lenk).There were niggles, but I really enjoyed this. This was a relatively shorter book compared to what I'm used to reading for YA, and the length did affect the story for me. I felt some things were rushed and skated over, particularly towards the end with the bullying. But overall, I thought the issues and consequences of bullying itself was still handled well enough for what was a light-hearted book. I also did feel things were just a bit too happy-go-lucky, with the successes of the play, the store, B's transformation. Generally, I like my YA stories to be more depressing, or at least emotionally heavier. But this also made it a nice change of pace. What worked for me so much was the MC, Collin, and Austin. I loved Collin's voice. He initially came off as snarky and moody as most teenagers are wont to be, but once he got over his anxieties over the move, he turned out to be a likeable character. A little self-centered, yes, not to mention flamboyant, but also funny and brave. I loved his relationship with Austin, the school outcast, and his family. I might have wished the story went deeper in some areas like the characterizations, but it still made me smile and feel hopeful, even tear up at times, crybaby I am.

Because of some intriguing new twist on vampires and other magical creature I believe there is potential in a sequel to this book. There wasn't a good romance in this story that I felt was really lacking. I liked the twin brother Joseph right away for her but then there was nothing. After discovering Tom's secret he sounds like a potential boyfriend material. There wasn't a good connection between any of the characters, I just wouldn't care if any of these people saw each other again. The strongest relationship seemed to be the brothers but by the end that seemed one-sided. With a little more character development and some real relationship bonds the next story could be really good. Maybe if Taylor and Joseph have a stronger bond that will put a strain on the brothers relationship. Tom and her roommate could complete a set of four  really close friends, with the possibility of her and Joseph getting together.

"I'm all for knowing where the characters are and what they're doing, but I don't need to know what each mile of road looks like. The dialogue is stilted and the plot advancement is just a little too convenient to be truly believable. One character expresses being tired of waiting and the other (literally overnight) decides to live life to the fullest and let the romance play out. Really, now?I like the music element and the bonding between the families. Toward the end, people seem to really develop backbones and real emotions, but it's such a small payoff after such a long read that it was almost not worth it.","If you can finish it, it's cute",1341446400,1,1,3,0

"Honestly, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about this book.  I liked the idea that a retired cop could still do so much, and I did enjoy the touch of the occult that went into this novel, but after that the rest of my review will be a little muddled.  Granted, I came into this book before reading book 1, and so some of the connections seemed a little far-stretched to me, but there are definitely a few things that I liked and disliked about this particular novel.The conversations and relationships between the characters seemed strained, and maybe even a little fake.  There were some things within the novel about solving the case that just seemed to be too easy, even with the aspect of the occult thrown in.I did like, however, the story itself.  The characters were interesting, and they each had their own quirks and strengths, which I liked.

"I'm torn over this one. The dialogue was amateurish (people don't call each other by name that often in normal conversation) and I thought the story could have used a better editor. There were a few character contradictions, too. For example, Diego says nothing matters but getting his wife over the border, yet he keeps standing up for other characters and putting his main objective in jeopardy. If there were more inner dialogue on his part about being compelled to do the right thing, it would have worked better.In the end, it was a good story that I kind of wished was part of a larger plot. Take away the fact that it takes place in the future, and it's just a regular crossing the border story that could apply to someone from Mexico crossing into the US.

Hailey was very closed mouthed about her past and really didnt make friends. Pete said he loved her, I just dont see how or why he would he say that. If you are a business partner with someone and they barely talk about themselves, how do you love them? Not only that, but he was in her house when she got back home. Did he have a key to her house? I doubt it. It was made so clear that she didnt get close to people, so why would she give him a key? After he told her that he loved her, he was kind of creepy to me. Saying he was going to fly to Detroit to get her if she wasnt home in how many ever days. Maybe it was just me, but he could have used a lot of work as well.

I liked the book and thought that the world created within was remarkably well constructed and had a believable feel to it most of the characters including some minor ones were well described and there was a sense of tension throughout the book.

But Nicholson is a brilliant writer, so I was reluctantly pulled into the story and had to finish it.  If you're interested in what goes on in the mind of a serial killer, this is the book for you; he has you feeling as much sympathy for the killer as for the victims.  Here's a sample of Nicholson's descriptive talent: ""Miles away, people huddled in front of the blue campfires of television sets, frantic from having too much time and burdened with having to spend it all.""

Jason Colby owns just about every thing in town - except the mine that the widowed Jenny has title to, and he's determined to buy it off her at any cost. Jenny has other plans, so of course you know the two are going to be butting heads at any and every opportunity. I won't spoil, but the most contrived plot twist ever forces Jenny to not only move into Jason's home, but to marry him as well (in name only of course). Then you get lots and lots of unresolved sexual tension between the two as Jason fights his attraction to Jennet (he's got a super secret from his past and he thinks Jenny will hate him if she finds out), plus Jenny's put off since Jason doesn't seem to care for her.Bah. The big secret is really not much of anything, and things just carried on far too long.

Someone is plotting to rid the suburban town of immigrants that come from south of the American border, a type of ethnic cleansing that is victimizing innocent people.Author Lorrie Farrelly touches on a relevant issue in her romantic suspense Dangerous, enlightening readers about the crimes which prejudices incite.  Fluid and detailed, Farrelly's writing style gives readers a multi-dimensional impression of her characters making them feel real.  Each one could be someone that the reader knows in real life making them personable and relatable to the reader.Chima Valley's new Chief of Police Cam Starrett is tough on the outside but compassionate and deeply sensitive inside.  He is the epitome of a romantic hero.  Meredith ""Merry"" Hayden is a proper lady as a high school counselor but turns into a fierce lioness when it comes to protecting people she cares about and holds in her heart.  The secondary characters like Merry's younger sister Lindy and Merry's student Oscar Alcosta form their own romance while furthering Merry and Cam's storyline.Beneath the bucolic surface of Chima Valley is a disturbing undercurrent that threatens the community's peace and security.  It's an undercurrent that Merry and Cam work together to uncover.  Their union is natural, although many coincidences such as Cam finding a place to live next door to Merry feels more like the author had a hand in making that happen.Dangerous has moments of suspense when the reader is unsure about what will happen next and which way the plot will turn.  These tense moments are put beside scenes denoting pure love and tenderness.

Quite a few grammatical issues, as well. Needs a good editor or three.Plot progression is solid, though exposition is weak in places, particularly the very beginning and the very end. The author also forgets to tie up loose ends on the main subplot, which is disappointing. I really enjoyed the fantasy tangent about halfway through--it melded perfectly with the rest of the story. Well done. Good characterization. Subplots get a bit messy; the author seems to struggle a little bit to keep it all organized and keep track of everything, but that's a common issue.Overall, the major problems could be fixed with a line editor and a developmental editor, and possibly some work with a writing consultant to help with some bad habits.The story is excellent, so I plan on trying further works by this author to see if the writing improves to match the story composition.","Good Story, Needs Work (Editor's Review)",1376438400,0,0,3,0

"The PortalBy Alan ZendellSet over one hundred years in the future in a declining society we meet a special boy, Harry who will soon leave his mark on the world. The story begins when Harry is fourteen after he loses his one friend and confidant, his grandfather, Harry spirals into a deep depression until he meets a remarkable girl that soon captures his heart.  Harry wants nothing more than to spend the rest of his life with Lorrie; instead he spends the rest of his life searching for her when she disappears.Throughout the story we follow along through each of Harry's loves and losses spanning his entire life, we also follow along through his triumphs in his own personal life as he is determined to effect change in the world around him and not just be a bystander in society.  The story itself is interesting, a love story mixed with futuristic political unrest. The author does a great job of getting his point across and describing the nation and the problems the world is facing drawing you into the story even further as you begin to hope for a solution. The only real problem with this book is that if you are going to set it in the future we need more descriptive scenery you wouldn't know it was a futuristic novel if the author didn't incorporate holograms and also add in dates so that you know how much time has passed between each event in Harry's life. If you don't mind relying on your own imagination when it comes to the scenery then this is definitely worth the read.I was sent a free copy of this book for an honest review.","Great story, need more details",1368748800,0,0,3,0

"I left off my review of the first book in trilogy, Call of the Herald, with: ""If early parts of second book show enough plot details and plot progression to keep my interest then I will likely finish the series - otherwise I will drop it.""  Although I was drawn to the characters, I was unable to keep enough interest in the storyline to finish this book.  There is nothing wrong with this story but there is nothing that makes it special enough for me to complete reading it.  My main frustration being that I prefer to understand more of the underlying conflict which is driving the action.  After reading book 1 and a fifth of book 2, I did not understand underlying conflicts and implications which made it hard for me to keep interest in this story.  Also, I was a little put off by ease in which Catrin picked up followers and the difficulty she has in using her magic in more critical scenes.  Overall, it is a good story which I would have read if I did not have other books lined up my reading list which were calling to me.This is the second book in the debut Godsland trilogy, The Dawning of Power trilogy,  which was available for free download when I ""bought"" it.  The trilogy opens withCall of the Herald (Godsland Series: Book One)(currently available for free download) and concludes withDragon Ore (Godsland Series: Book Three).  There is an omnibus edition of the first 3 books available,The Dawning of Power (Godsland Series: Books One, Two, and Three).  Author has started a second Godsland trilogy, the Balance of Power trilogy.  The first book in the second trilogy has been published,Regent (Godsland Series: Book Four).  Note that the Amazon product page refers to this as Godsland book 4 while the author's website refers to this as book one of the new Godsland based Balance of Power trilogy.No major editing issues noted in the few chapters which I read. Call of the Herald is 4,110 Kindle locations long. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.

"CharactersKat is a very upbeat, practical person, with a very interesting view on journalism. A good deal about her is revealed over the course of the book, helping develop her character in ways the twelve hours the book takes place in wouldn't normally allow.Other characters do appear in the book, in fact, many of them, but none have enough 'screen time' to be categorized as a major character. Instead, we're given a large cast of mostly unique and interesting individuals that we meet briefly through Kat's interactions with them. Most people do feel reasonably different from the others, but the style of the book doesn't give much chance to develop them very far. Even so, none of the characters seem dull or uninteresting.PlotThe story follows Kat Auton as she does a twelve-hour marathon session covering the events leading up to the launch of a brand new, highly advanced spaceship called Friendship, which is to be the first vessel crewed by humans and aliens. Kat is an independant reporter who contracted with a smaller station for her show, and she's also one of Friendship's small and very heavily screened media team, giving her access to nearly all areas related to this event, something most journalists don't have. The story rolls along but at a fairly slow pace, moving through the day, building up the character and personality of Kat, and more importantly, the setting itself, through her conversations, both to the camera, and with the others she meets throughout the day, many of whom she interviews. An element of suspense is introduced about halfway through the book, hinting at more going on than is normal, or expected.Overall, the story itself is fairly decent, and the interactions are interesting. However, I feel that it moves a bit too slowly at times, as a little too much time is spent digressing into explanations of this or that, necessary for the world-building aspect of the story, but bogging down the story a bit. There's also a section right after Kat has an entourage of other journalists foisted on her where she ends up explaining the same thing about the other journalists to other characters several time, greatly slowing things down during that particular section. The interactions between Kat and the others, as well as finding out more about the world, was generally enough to keep me interested and going, though.DesignAlthough I can't comment on the book itself, as I read this in Kindle format, the cover image is simply okay. It does suggest both sci-fi and journalism, but I don't think the person looks all that good. (My apologies if this was done on an actual model...)WritingThe writing itself is generally readable. One thing to bear in mind is that it is young adult fiction, but I felt some of the phrasings were rather off, and some characters did tend to ramble on too long. That may have been the intent, though, given that the story is following a twelve-hour marathon reporting session. It actually felt a bit more rough in the first chapter than the rest of the book, perhaps not quite as polished.Overall3 stars on Sarah's Star SystemRecommended ForIf you're looking for a book that focuses primarily on brief interactions with a sci-fi backdrop, this is a good story to pick up.Review by: John of Sift Book ReviewsSift Book Reviews received a free copy for review from the author.

"Tim Kizer recently contacted me and asked me to review his novella,Intoxication (a psycho thriller) (As the Darkness Falls), which is a psychological thriller. Some have compared it to ""horror"" stories by Stephen King, which I have to say I am not a huge fan of, but I found this to be more suspenseful than horror filled. Yes, it is based on murder and does contain some strong language, but the story is more about the psychological state of mind of the main character than the events that are taking place.Positive: This story has a very unique plot that has twists and turns that are not predictable. I have to say that I did read the reviews of this novella before I started reading the story, and I knew that there was a surprise ending, and I STILL didn't guess what it was. Typically when I know that a story has a surprise ending, I am always on the lookout for what it will be, and usually have it figured out. That was not the case in this instance.Constructive Criticism: I hesitate to point out that this book has grammatical errors because I believe that it is self-published and did not have the benefit of professional editing services, but I would be remiss not to mention them because they are present. I also feel like the story could be just a tad bit longer to develop the characters and embellish the theories of why the main character believes what she does. It quickly becomes obvious that she has some psychological issues, and developing those thoughts more thoroughly would help the reader comprehend why she believes her theories.Finally, if you enjoy suspenseful stories, especially short novellas, and don't mind a touch of strong language, you would probably enjoy this. There is a bonus novella, Hitchhiker, and a 1,000 word short story, The Bike, included. I enjoyed each of these as well. Both of these also have unique plot twists and surprises that you won't see coming. I think that Tim Kizer is an up and coming author with a ton of great potential.",Psychological Thriller,1309910400,1,1,3,0

"William MacLeod Raine's specialty was the western, and TANGLED TRAILS is subtitled ""A Western Detective Story."" However, the novel is about as much a western as anything Agatha Christie ever wrote. The only thing westerly about it is location: Wyoming and Colorado. Otherwise, it's a modern (1921) mystery in which cattleman and rodeo star Kirby Lane sets out to help his friend Rose McLean who, in turn, is trying to help her sister Esther, who has gotten involved with a man who has impregnated her out of wedlock, a no-no in that era. The man is her employer, James Cunningham, who happens to be Kirby Lane's uncle.When Cunningham is murdered, Lane sets out to find his killer because he, Lane, is one of the numerous suspects.The book is a pleasant diversion and a throwback to an era when pulp fiction, which this is reminiscent of, was very popular. Don't worry about some of its implausibilities; just trot along for the ride. Oh, wait! It's not a cowboy tale of the ""wild west."" Lane mostly travels by car or train. It's more like a B-movie detective story. So cruise along for the ride.","Fun reading, if not altogether believable",1328227200,13,13,3,0

There is one demon that will always remain with her no matter what. Several years ago Devlin saved her from the demon who killed her family.

"Rachel Vincent's Reaper is a novella set in her SOUL SCREAMERS world. I read it because it was free for members at Audible during one of their promotions. I haven't read any of the SOUL SCREAMERS novels, but I'm familiar with the premise because I've read Kelly's reviews of the series.Reaper is the story of how Tod, sacrificing himself for his impulsive younger brother Nash, became a reaper. We get to know Tod, Nash, and their mom pretty well. We also learn a bit about Sabine, Nash's girlfriend, and Addison, Tod's ex-girlfriend-turned-pop-star.Fans of the SOUL SCREAMERS series won't want to miss Reaper because it contains a moving background story. However, this novella can stand alone for those who haven't started the series yet, and it may be a quick and easy way to discover if you want to venture further into Vincent's world.Personally, I struggled with Reaper -- not because there was anything wrong with it (there wasn't), but simply because it was devastatingly emotional. I don't like stories where the crux of the plot involves children or teenagers getting hurt. As the mother of two teenage boys who are very close to each other, I thought this story was especially disturbing. It was a lot like reading the famous Dear Abby column called ""Please, God, I'm Only 17."" If you don't mind that sort of emotional gut punch, you'll like this one better than I did.Reaper is available on Kindle or audiobook. The audiobook version was read by Anthony Haden. His performance was good except that I didn't like the slimy voice he used for Nash. However, Kelly, who has read the series, thought the slimy voice was appropriate.Originally posted at Fantasy Literature.",Soul Screamers novella,1341014400,0,0,3,0

"Tempting Mr. Parker starts out with a confrontation between Cade, the older white wealthy guy, and Shakara, the young African-Amercan girl who has had a very difficult childhood. Cade berates her for being in his home because he strongly disapproves of her and because of what she does (or did) for a living. Shakara is a former stripper and now works in a Hooters style restaurant. Shakara is feisty on the outside but a bit of a doormat on the inside. She fights back when Cade confronts her but inwardly she admires his physique even while he berates her. Cade makes his opinion of Shakara quite clear yet for some reason Shakara is secretly attracted to him. My first impression of both Cade and Shakara are not good at all. Cade is a downright jerk for being so nasty to Shakara. He clearly feels superior and strongly disapproves her and her background and is not a gentleman in how he expresses his feelings. He even has a rule that she must address him as Mr. Parker.His extreme outward behavior is to mask his shame and embarrassment he feels about being attracted to Shakara. Shakara allows herself to be disrespected while secretly longing for a man who is treating her like she is far beneath him.I'm sure you've got a feeling for my impression of Cade by now. Unfortunately my opinion didn't change much throughout the story even after he revealed his affections for Shakara. He went from demeaning her to `I love you and you should love me back now' rather quickly. He did eventually go above and beyond to win Shakara's affections so he gets points for that but his actions toward her in the beginning bordered on cruel and I had a hard time forgiving him.Shakara has had romantic feelings for Cade since she first became friends with his sister several years before. She has lived on her own from an early age and has done what she had to do to survive. I felt a strong sense of sympathy for her for the most part but her attraction to Cade just didn't make sense. He was never kind to her until he made his big declaration of love and she went from putting up with his abuse to accepting his love very quickly. Shakara is a street smart girl who has practically raised herself so I really had to question why she was so quick to trust Cade even with her long felt attraction to him.I've done some complaining about the two main players and it sounds as though I didn't enjoy the book. The thing is, even with my criticisms of the characters, I did enjoy reading this story so I really struggled with how to rate it. Tempting Mr. Parker appealed to my love of imperfect protagonists where I can hope for redemption and my affection for the Cinderella troupe. Although I found both Cade and Shakara to be questionable in character, the story still held enough water for me to want to continue to read. I held out hope for both Cade and Shakara until the very end hoping for the magic ""ah-ha"" moment were I would come to understand where they were coming from on an emotional level and understand their attraction to each other. That moment never came yet at the end of it all I was happy they found happiness in each other.",Tempting Mr. Parker,1297814400,2,2,3,0

"Background: In this Novella, Emily is invited to a party in her neighborhood and witnesses some strange activities and people. She does not normally come to these types of things. While there she witnesses a murder and it is up to her and another neighbor Dr. Muriel to solve the puzzle.Review: First impressions I had while reading this were, `boy are these sentences super long.' It made it very hard to read since it was hard to gauge where a sentence would finally end. I felt like I was taking too much time re-reading these sentences rather than paying attention to the plot of the mystery. And when I read a mystery I want to try and remember all the details to see if I can figure it out before the end.As for the story, I did enjoy it. There were a few quarks that were interesting, there is a carnival performance theme to the party Emily attends and the characters are funny and weird. It also forced me to remember some facts about drama that I learned while in Grad school and that was cool.I felt like Emily, the main character, is a little off, she was almost annoyingly talking to everyone about the death of her dog. Now I know this is a big deal, and when my dog passes I will not leave my house for weeks, BUT if I were Emily going to a party that had a bunch a weird artsy people and shows and things, I could at least TRY to have some fun while there, she just obsessed and then figured out a murder had occurred.I think that it is hard to really develop a story in a novella...so there were things I was confused about. All in all the mystery was interesting and I am about to read Showstoppers, the next book, so maybe more character development there.","Murder at a Party, how fun!",1360281600,0,0,3,0

"I read a few of the reviews before I bought the first book (ANTZ) and discovered that although the author writes a decent fable, none of the ""trilogy"" (which isn't remotely a trilogy apparently) is not much more than a long short story or novella, or worse, a series of chapters cut into chunks to sell as separate products.  Each book ends in the middle of a scene picked up in the next.  Really, I'd rather have paid the full price for a single book than wade through this marketing nonsense.  And the author does it again at the ""end"" of the 3rd ""book"" of the ""trilogy"".  BTW, he pulls the same marketing stunt with his ""mercenary"" book which doesn't end but includes a postscript about a prequel being out in 2012.

And the whole automatic doors meeting said witch was done well.

Mostly related to who Logan was, what where all the references to his past about, and how was he able to do everything he did. It almost seemed like this was the second book in the series. All my questions were answered near the end of the story, but it seemed a bit backwards. Since I didn't really understand Logan, his abilities or his past, this was another reason I didn't connect with him.Overall, this was an entertaining read.

"For You is the first book in Kristen Ashley's The Burg series. Intense is too tame a word for this book. I love Kristen Ashley's books. Hell, I've read twelve of them. That said, I have issues with 'For You'. One in particular: the time frame.SPOILERS:Feb and Alec (Colt) were high school sweethearts. She walks in on him making out with another woman (the shiest woman in the world) on a bed and leaves without saying anything then dumps him the following day without telling him why a.k.a what she saw. Twenty years later, Alec still doesn't know what he did. We're not talking about five or ten years later. We're talking about TWENTY FREAKING YEARS! A woman, any woman who walks in on the love of her life making out on a bed with another woman would say something when she caught him or at least told him he'd been caught the day after when she broke it off. To me, it doesn't make sense. Had she done either, like a normal woman, she would've realized her boyfriend had been drugged, and it was all set-up by her stalker.Feb's stalker has been watching her since high school, drugged Alec, sent in the other woman whom he knew had a crush on Alec, so Feb could catch them in the act. It works. Feb catches Alec and breaks it off without so much as saying why. The other woman (shiest woman in the world) sees Feb walk in and feels guilty (she too had been drugged). Another guy, stalker's friend, watches all this. NO ONE SAYS anything for TWENTY YEARS! TWENTY YEARS!!!! And her stalker never makes a move for TWENTY YEARS! What was the purpose of breaking them up if he didn't plan to keep her himself? Instead the stalker marries another woman and goes on with his life. AGAIN, makes no sense.If it had been five or even ten years, I wouldn't have a problem, but in my opinion twenty years is too long a time frame for all of it.The book is good. I enjoyed it.

"I think it's great the regular people who have stories to tell can get their stuff published through the invention of Kindle books.  From the cover art of a photo of someone's cat with text that you can't clearly read against the background, probably done in a basic art piece of software like Paint or something, you've got no doubt going in that Mouse is Missing is someone's homemade short story and there's not going to be editors or anyone like this involved.  I think this is a good thing as it allows non professional writers to tell the tale the way they want to.  Sometimes typos and confusing sentences can creep in with no editor involved but with Mouse is Missing the author or someone she had proof read it has done a good job, I didn't notice any spelling mistakes.  The author (I'm guessing an older lady just by the way this is written) has also given her other pets their five minutes of fame by including little photos of them at various stages of the story. That's basically what the tale is, one of her pets (a young cat called Bon Bon) has lost its toy mouse. It asks the other animals in the house, they either don't care, don't talk to cats, or don't know. However one pet accuses the cats who live outside in the barn of the crime, since you know their kind can't be trusted.  If Bon Bon wants his toy back, which he really does, he's going to have to go outside for the first time in his life and confront them.It's not so much a junior fiction short story that kids would read themselves but more a tale a grandparent would read to a grandchild sitting beside them in a big comfy chair or something.  It's one of those instead of having human child characters we'll use animals moralistic teaching through a story read, with the cat acting a little bit human childlike at times.  In this case the moral not to judge others by their kind, where they live even if other people are saying things negative about them and telling you not to talk or be friends with them.You can tell when reading this by the quality of the writing that it is a non professionally written short story. However the basic plot is fairly good one.

"The point of this novella was two fold, one to introduce the world and the circumstances, and two to get the readers hooked with the free price.  I say it's worth it. It had a great story line.  I mean the thought of the world collapsing has been in many books and movies over the years and is nothing new.  What is new is that Spirit animals need to bond with humans to help form a new community.  It is the hope that with the instincts of animals and the guidance of these animals the new humanity would not kill each other.The characters needed to be developed more.  Elysia was so interesting, I felt as if she was held back by the author's writing rather than being enhanced by it.  Darien was just normal and really had no depth either. I felt as if the author did a good job hooking me, because I'd like to read more about this new community and see how it fairs against other human communities that thrive on violence.  At the same time though I hope that she develops her other books more fully and the characters get a chance to speak for themselves.Hey the e-book is free, it took me about 35-45 minutes to read, and it was interesting.

But the writing was embarrassingly in need of heavy editing. Run on sentences, wrong word choices, creative spelling and elementary grammar and punctuation errors muddled the writing on nearly every page. I've been told that formatting text to Kindle  can produce glaring errors, but unless this was done with a primitive predictive text program,  there is no explanation for these strings of grammatical problems. Bring back the editors! Put them to work! Please! 4 stars for story telling ,and 2 because I hated the mangling. But if you enjoy a pleasant hea story with a side of suspense, and messy writing doesn't make you crazy, this is an ok read. After all, I read itt twice, apparently.

Antonia's older brothers have been trying to control her life for years so the last thing she wants is to have another man take over controlling her.  Brett is her brother's friend who can't get Antonia out of his head.  Will Antonia be able accept falling in love with a strong dominant man?  I have to agree with some of the other reviews.  Antonia speaks of being strong and making her own decisions.  She even gets mad when life decisions are taken out of her control and yet each time it happens she quickly gives up.

"An average of three stars because it was really just an okay story. Nothing in these pages reached out and grabbed readers, in fact, it shot down expectations left and right. It was well written, so I'll give it that. But for being a book that I would recommend, it missed the mark, buy being just a time killer.No romance, and isn't that why we read? To get lost in a fantasy, thinking, I wish that I had that experience under my belt.The dialog between the women was boring, and somewhat confusing.But let's be honest; How could 4 women, minus one, actually think that they would reunite with a man that slept with them mere moments after meeting them? Certainly, he couldn't be holding a flame for them many years later. Not that they knew each other prior to this story.

"Butterface is a cute and touching story about Beth, a teenage girl with a facial deformity. Beth is used to hiding herself from the world. She has resigned herself to being one of the girls that will never be noticed for her beauty. While dealing with her self-esteem issues, she has a weird relationship with Lucky. They banter back and forth, with her making fun of him being a soccer god and his good looks. Lucky takes the jibes in stride and fusses over the fact that Beth works too much. Their relationship starts off as a friendship but develops into something more. Lucky breaks through the wall that Beth hides behind, finally sees her as more than a friend all thanks to a pink tank top.Butterface is a nice, quick read with fully developed characters and plot.

"What most struck me most about ""Amber Magic"" is how quickly with just a single choice an author can radically alter our opinions of their books. ""Amber Magic"" Isn't the most brilliant fantasy novel ever written, it's formulaic and the story encompasses what would normally pass for the first third of any fantasy book in the publishing world (i.e. simple boys destined to make a quest, something evil finds them and they must flee. That is this book in the series). But I found myself enjoying it and while the character development isn't top notch it was obviously strong enough that I was read to buy the next volume and continue reading the story, then in the last 15 or even 10 pages the author makes a choice which seems more like something that would occur in a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" game rather than something which seems fitting of the Robert Jordan high fantasy mode that the rest of the book is written in.I find myself unable to recommend this book despite the fact that I was enjoying until that choice was made (It was that jarring to me).",Disturbing ending,1345852800,2,2,3,0

"Before the critical comments, let me say I really enjoyed the book (mostly) and will read the other two in the series.1.  Awkward WritingLocation 4835 is just one tiny sample of oh, so many awkward passages:  ""Towsan remained standing as was the Duchess, looking all around the compound....""2.  Words Used IncorrectlyA partial list:  palette, effected, lowly, breath (breathe), plains of her face, thrush, righteous indignity, fiscal, innocuously (used when author meant inconspicuously).3. Limited Range of Facial ExpressionsLet me count the ways:  scowl (42), frown (234), glare (52), smile (348), grin (153), smirk (66).4. Modern Slang in Pseudo-Medieval SettingExcept for Balan (whose use of modern American slang was so appropriate because he had attended a community college), use of British or Americanisms such as yikes, gig, for crying out loud, pitching woo, skivvies, chew the fat, and so forth, stuck out like sore thumbs and distracted from the flow of a story set in a pseudo-medieval world.And, oddly enough, quite a few words used in their archaic meanings, rather than in their current ones.  I wanted to say to the author, ""Make up your mind.""5. Backstory and Descriptive Passages Long, Boring, Superfluous, TediousI dreaded every change of scene, knowing that it would subject me to over-described, page after page of excruciating detail.  Author needs to learn the balance between description and action.  Just because he can compose gorgeous descriptions of every mountain valley and create vivid mental imagery of every city street, doesn't mean he should.Chapter 9 was mostly superfluous, as was the ronin's story.  As I read, I take notes, and over and over I've written in my notes, ""Long, boring, too much back story, awkward.""6. Character NamesThis comment is mostly a matter of taste.  There are quite a few characters in this story, many of them with difficult and exotic names.  Hard to pronounce or spell; difficult to remember and keep straight (C. J. Cherryh had this problem in her early books).  The trick is to invent exotic names that readers can remember easily, or give them memorable nicknames.  Your opinion may differ.7. ConclusionThis was an interesting first book of a trilogy that I believe to have lots of potential to be an excellent body of writing.  I'd like to see this fine author find himself a fine editor, and rise above the ranks of the mediocre, into the ranks of the top notch fantasy writers, where I firmly believe he could shine.","""Sable City"" Review",1336608000,52,52,3,0

"George Alfred Henty (1832-1902) was a prolific author who is noted for his historical novels written for young men.  Those that I have read all feature a young, courageous and heroic youth whose life is woven into true historical events.  They are well-written and entertaining, and always include some local color or history that also makes them educational.Henty was a Victorian imperialist, which shows through in his books.  Some criticize him for this, as well as for his propensity to categorize people by nationality, race and religion - often very harshly degrading those his heroes are opposing.  He is, truly, a product of his time and should be judged so; I suspicion that his critics (who conform to today's political correctness) would have, if born in Henty's time, been as racist and narrow-minded as he.One of the most interesting aspects of his books is the level of knowledge he assumes of his readers.  It is depressing that many (too many) of our young men would be stumped to fully understand his work.I generally enjoy Henty's books as occasional light reading.  ""The Young Colonists"" was published in 1885, a few years after the British defeat and imperialistic retreat in the First Boer War.  Henty's jingoism and bitterness pervades just about every page.  Henty's youthful hero is present at all the British military disasters; this provides Henty with plenty of opportunities to criticize British incompetence (or bad luck) and to bemoan the (temporary) ascendance of either the Zulus or the Boers.If you are to read just one Henty book, any of this others would be a better choice.  That said, I do not regret having read ""The Young Colonists"".  I just cannot give it more than three stars.",Typical Henty but far from his ususal standards,1362873600,0,0,3,0

She simply has her own life where he feels he has no place.But is this empty life all that is in store for Tim?Can he ever let go of his past and build a new future?Will Mona and Tim drift apart or make more effort to rekindle their love?Who is the spy in their circle of acquaintances who is feeding every intimate detail and conflict between them to the media?A very promising plot and a very interesting start but I feel the story just didn't get developed to its full potential. I had loved the initial attraction between Mona and Tim and rejoiced in their joy of getting married but the story started lagging after Tim's accident. Firstly, there is simply no role of either Mona's or Tim's family in the story. I was astonished that they didn't have any role after Tim's devastating accident and his problems in adapting since! Mona's father is mentioned once or twice but Tim's family has just vanished !!This was so unbelievable after all the ranting about how both their families were so close and had supported their children but what happened when they needed them the most?For Mona's family I just got the feel that they valued money and image over their daughter's problems and happiness. Even later its just implied that they talked only business with Mona with no effort to connect with their son-in-law.Also I had no good points for Mona. She got totally irritating about halfway through the story with her ""no explanations and no caring"" attitude. I just couldn't understand her sudden change in nature with her totally out-of-character choice of big bungalows and showoff while no time and care towards her once loved-above-everything husband. I felt sorry for Tim and totally understood his plight. The importance of dialogue between husband and wife is expertly emphasized by the author here.The story just didn't get developed properly. The part with Suzy was also unsatisfactorily closed. No dialogue is their between what Tim already knew about Suzy and what Mona realized later. Suzy is just flicked aside and although Tim doesn't know that Mona has taken care of this angle he doesn't even ask or for that matter tell Mona about her at the end when they finally talk. Also the infidelity angle is left undiscussed.The ending is somewhat abrupt with a sudden change in Mona but no realization of her wrong attitude all these past years. The book ends with Tim elaborating his plans and Mona (oh I am not certain what to make of her) just saying yes to everything (I don't know if she meant it or not). I just didn't connect with the characters in the book. Only Tim looked real and that too in some parts of the book. I think the best character in the story is Tina, who is competent, a sympathetic listener and a strong woman who is trying to make her way even after all the setbacks she has had in her life.This could have been a great book had it been more detailed and with more depth to it. I give ""Stars Shine After Dark"" a 3 out of 5 because I was somewhat left unsatisfied at the end. The writing of Paula is crisp and engaging but more time and thought was needed while preparing the plot.This review is also available on blog Njkinny's World of Books..",A promising plot but not developed to its full potential...,1382918400,1,1,3,0

"The title of this book may lead you to believe that this was going to be a ""how-to"" in utilizing Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets. However, it is really isn't much about using social networks. What it is a strong reminder of how we as the church should be responding to those in this world. Facebook reports as of September 2012 1 billion users, never before have we've been so connected. Yet the author points out what people really want is relationship.With excellent examples and imagery Mr. Sweet drives home that the media isn't that important. What is important is developing relationships with people, demonstrating God's love in tangible ways.I will admit after a point I felt like I ""got the message"" while the author continued to remind me. I did enjoy the reminders and there were many great points made throughout the book.If you are looking for a how-to use Twitter or Facebook then this is not the book for you.

"The Chroniech are back and looking for a rematch. This is the third in the series and has the same light elements as the other two: superficial characters, rapidly acquired and applied technology usually attributed to one individual and a type of deus ex machina ending. The strengths are some of the descriptions of the nature and effect of the weapons like the Harrington series by Weber. But the battles are so large and the outcome (in most cases) pre determined, that it seems like an extraneous detail. The battle might involve hundreds if not thousands of ships and the details of some small number of ships in the group being destroyed by a specific weapon system is interesting but ultimately irrelevant. It is like reading how a few soldiers died in a company level conflict (but without the emotional impact)  Although the author does give some delay to putting new weapons systems into place in the middle of a war, when you take into account that this will span light years, different planets and cultures, the speed is still excessive.

Even though he killed Alan Matthews, he continues to feel guilty about putting Abigail and Brynn and the people of Red Rock in harms way. Sasha is a witch. Werewolves and witches have a long history and do not trust each other. Even though Sasha helps defeat Alan Matthews and his pack, the people of Red Rock still don't trust her.I loved the relationship between Dylan and Sasha. They both saw themselves as a hindrance to people where in fact, they were both a great help. Dylan isn't an alpha male but his protective instincts kick into gear when he's around Sasha. The attraction is mutual and they get to explore that attraction when they are sent on assignment by their Alpha Gavin. Dylan is very careful not to do anything that would scare Sasha. Sasha is stronger than he thinks. Maybe a little skittish considering what she's been through, but definitely strong.Sanctuary's Price is a good read.

No children (defeats a wolf having a mate logic)b. Children are all mortal(again, defeats the purpose of a werewolf mate)c. Children are werewolves, but they are raised by a surrogate family.d.

"This really needs to be a 3.5-star book.  Or three for most people and four for the exact target audience.Right.  If you don't like manga, don't read this book.

This will also drive you up the wall.That being said, if you know manga and are a teen, this is a decent to good read.  Trapped on Draconica throws off the mindset of adulthood and wallows in teenagerness.  Everything teens like to do when thrown into a situation they don't understand is here.

"I picked this because it was a Kindle freebie, and I like the adoption scenario. It was my first McLinn.I liked the plotline, the hero discovering that he had a teenage son he never knew about and going ""undercover"" to meet him. But the writing was a little jerky, disjointed. And as a romance, this didn't work for me, primarily because I didn't like the heroine. Spending time with her grew more and more tiresome. And the author dragged out their story too long; the book was three quarters over before they became intimately involved and there wasn't anything else happening to compensate for the waiting time. I did like the hero initially, but I was a little weary of him by the end, too. And I didn't really understand why his behaviour and actions were the only ones that people felt free to criticize and correct - continuously.Actually, not understanding the characters' behaviours was an increasing problem. They never reacted in a way that made sense to me. The things that upset me they didn't notice, and the things that upset them didn't ring true. The last half of this book seemed interminable.However, there was some potential here. I liked all the secondary characters, which means the author CAN create people about whom I care.

The romance between the two leads went so fast, I found it a bit unbelievable. Our heroine seemed a bit too contemporary minded for the times, and considering her situation. Minor points that niggled at me while I read. Though the book is not graphic in the bedroom, I felt that was all these two people based their whole lives and feelings on, if so they were a bit shallow!

"AGF: The Gathering (Anything Goes Fighters)The Gathering is a good mix between a buddy story and an action adventure tale. The story takes place in the decaying empire of Thena. But is this a post apocalyptic America, a fantasy nation from the past, or a futuristic civilization? Author Sam White introduces us to various clues as the plot unravels. The back story involves a once proud Emperor John who was murdered to make way for the corrupt Emperor Charles. Under Charles' rule the nation falls into chaos and violence. Placing this fantasy adventure in this setting keeps the reader on his toes. You never know where the next attack is coming from or who to trust.The plot revolves around street wise orphan Mick Rhoda, who has taken up with a dim-witted giant named Ollie in order to stage fights and con his way to easy money. As the two travel the countryside they encounter such characters as Greg the gay dwarf, a one armed warrior woman, a Makowian woman named Tyaira, a blind mystic, and others just as interesting.The group is under almost constant attack and bond together as they begin to see a higher calling for a more noble cause. It's within this context that White underscores the action with questions on class judgment, prejudice, justice, and alienable rights. I enjoyed this type of thought provoking material within the action genre. It brought the overall tone of the work to a higher level without becoming preachy or overbearing.The author had the good sense to add strong women to the group of societal castoffs. Most action or buddy reads involve women as love interest or eye candy and little more. White's female characters are complex and sometimes flawed. Early on in the novel he shows the reader Bunny as an example of such complexities.The underlying theme of the book is power. Not who has it, but exactly how you get it, and in what way do you use it? All of the misfits on Mick's journey have a talent but no power until they learn to band together. Once they get organized the question is, can they control it?  This idea isn't new but Smith approaches it in a fresh manner by never overtly addressing it. Instead the action moves the characters to an inescapable conclusion.I could easily see this as an animated movie or series. White has created unique and interesting characters that he describes with such clarity and detail you feel you know them. Does the work appeal to more than just sci-fi fans? I think so. The subplots, and social comments were interesting and as I commented on earlier were thought provoking. It's a fun read that flows well throughout.",The Gathering is Good SciFi.

"I'm a big fan of Sienna Mynx and have purchased every Kindle book available, but this one didn't sit well with me because there were a lot of inconsistencies.  For one, it's not clear to me why the Queen is at times totally cold and unfeeling and suddenly in love.  Nor do I understand how she can go from being a virgin to suddenly sleeping with two men within the span of 24 hours.  Finally, she's this strong ruler at the beginning of the day and then by the end of the day she's willingly turning her power over to another.  It just didn't fit in a lot of ways.  Having said that I enjoyed the historical aspects of the story and Ms. Mynx is a good writer so I give it 3 stars.

"I have had this book for many months and I have attempted to read it several times. The problem I have is that the storyline is excellent, but the writing drags tremendously, in my opinion. I know that some people appreciate this ""full disclosure"" type of writing. I'm just not one of those people. I don't think it's necessary to know the look of the scene at every moment, or the clothes the characters are wearing, or other things that really don't pertain to the story, especially in a story that is supposed to be fast-paced. I understand bringing the characters and scenery to life, but I feel this book goes too far, and it loses me every time I try to read it. I can't recommend this book unless the person who is going to read it appreciates too much explanation (I say 'too much', but I agree that for some, it's not too much - this is strictly my opinion).

The stage was set with two strong characters of Faldon and Selina, with Faldon bearing a curse, which makes him untrustworthy to his own people. The thing I found most confusing was how they travelled to and from hither and fro, to the extent that I didn't know whether they were coming or going.

There were places where the outcomes were predictable, but overall the story will keep you wondering what's coming next.While this is a book about a serial killer and his enablers (and I don't want to minimize that), it is also about the growth of the main character.

"Obviously from the cover this is a self published short story.  I always like to read stories by amateur writers as you find some really great undiscovered talent.  This is not one of those times, it wasn't a poorly written short story it just wasn't anything great either.  The first part goes for too long, I imagine a lot of readers would have stopped reading before the better part of the story starts (when the robots meet the human kids on the way to school).  Starts of using alien specific technical jargon a lot, although they are made up words you sort of have the feeling you do when someone uses insider technical jargon including acronyms for their workplace when trying to justify their actions and you are on the phone to them or something.  Bizarrely in a scenario where the aliens don't know much about humans, (hence why they need to send two information gathering robots to Earth) they have just had a war with Saturn where they battled the Uranians, so somehow they call the planets the same thing we do. Then we have a pretty boring getting ready for school scene.  Even though this is a short story, the boring introduction scenes needed to be much shorter.  Possibly a few more scenes involving the confused robots at school before meeting ""Mom"" would have been good too.  I also didn't buy that the kids would let the robots do what they do, surely they'd know that's wrong and they'd get in trouble for that.The whole thing isn't that long, it will take you maybe twelve to fifteen minutes at most to read.

He finds that he is able to travel to about a dozen predefined locations around the globe, some of them in the past and some in the future. Having a  science background, he dedicates his life to exploring these portals, trying to master the advanced technology of the equipment found in the cave complex and also the intent of the aliens who originally built it all.He methodically brings together a distinguished and trusted scientific team to help in his investigations.  They set up science labs at the cave complex and at various locations around Seattle. They also establish base camps at each of the portal destinations. After several decades, the team finally begins to break-through the alien technology and the great mystery is slowly unraveled.If you like time-travel sci-fi, you'll really enjoy this book.

In fact, Mandy's visions -- which are written in italics -- made no sense to me at all until I was in the third chapter.

There is a man in black who might be an embodiment of evil...or not, as the case may be. Mandy's best friend, Meg or Meagan, is probably in love with Cord, the mercantile owner and he with her but some undisclosed reason is keeping them apart.

Also, I still haven't figured out the villain's reasons and reasoning for all the terrible things that he did.

"I have become a fan of R Lee Smith because of the vast creativity and imagination that the author exhibits in all the novels written so far.  Smith has a definite flair for words, building scenes and creating unique worlds in which well developed characters react with each other.  All actions, scenes, and world background are shown by way of the characters thoughts and actions.  This includes ""bad"" characters - ones you will hate, the ""good"" characters - although not perfect, and the ""in between"".  In some ways - all of Smith's characters whether alien or not are too human - not being alsolutely perfect.  Smith unquestionably believes in ""Show"" and not just ""Tell"" a story.This is without doubt a ""Show"" novel.  Almost like a living chronicle of what happens to Olivia with the daily dialogs, actions and events that happen to her.  According to the product description, this novel is the uncut edition which lead to the one big problem that I had - it bogged down in many parts because I would become overwhelmed with the slow rate of actions and the extreme details of what was happening.  The author does a wonderful job of ""setting the stage"" with details but the details, I found, could be a little distracting and not really that necessary to the story at times.Readers do need to be informed that Smith does not always deliver the standard HEA - that the ""bad"" guys can ""win"" and get an ""HEA"" or that ""unconventional"" HEA's do occur.  I understand that I was very vague for a review but I'm not going to do any spoilers, but I will warn readers this much:- Don't pick up a R Lee Smith book unless you are looking for a non-standard Sci-Fi or PNR.- That while it is a creative fiction it may take you places that you really do not want to go with graphic or gory scenes- That you may be inundated with details.- That HEA's can be unconventional",Creativity - Out of this World - But very slow read,1337644800,0,0,3,0

It's a great premise, and several times in the book the author comes up with situations and dialogue that have a strong sense of character and show good insights into the characters.

You have to be comfortable with being someone Jane might write long letters to, where nothing much happens but you learn a bit about her evolving relationship with her husband.","OK, but not great",1306713600,10,10,3,0

"Zadie's negative attitude leads to the loss of her boyfriend, job and flat. Now she's determined to be a yes girl. Yes, she'd love to flat sit while the owner is away, but one look at the mess and she wishes she'd said no. No is the last thing Tristan expects to hear when he proposes in front of his girlfriend's family. Humiliated, he hides out in his brother's empty flat without asking because he really doesn't want to hear another no. What he needs is a woman who'll say yes...yes...yes... Could that be Zadie?Cute short read.  Plot is all it can be for how short it is.  If you need a quick read, go for it!  Especially since it's free!","Eh, cute for a quick read",1300579200,0,0,3,0
"Yes, plotting and plot development, character development, dialogue are all good.  As an audio book I would have no complaints at all.  Well, maybe one.  The author feels it is necessary to explain every foreign phrase, every acronym, and every use of initials immediately after it is used.  This wouldn't be so bad except that he does it even in dialogue and without ever setting the explanation off with parenthesis.  The flow of the story would be better served if he used an index of foreign words, acronyms, initials.  Or simply footnotes could serve the same purpose.  But I would think that a real wordsmith would find a way of incorporating the explanation within the storyline, itself.  For instance, when speaking of a command post and wanting to use the letters CP an author should be able to use a device similar to having having someone ask where the command post will be and someone else answers that the CP will be in a certain location.  Problem solved  The readers don't have such short memories that they won't remember what a CP is. The use of homonyms would go unnoticed in audio books, but is very distracting to a reader.  Instances in this book; isle for aisle, since for sense, coordinance for coordinates, and the almost word synch for cinch.  (That is not meant to be an all-inclusive list.)  Also, the indiscriminate use of commas serves only to break the flow of the story when a well-placed comma should actually enhance understanding.Artistically, a well-told story; an ""A"" or better.  As to the mechanics of writing, given the level of word usage, punctuation, etc, I'd be hard pressed to give it a passing mark.  Overall, an OK.",Jungle Writing Rules,1350950400,0,0,3,0

"Who would have know that Death could come in the form of a 10 year old girl?  But that is exactly what Ashley is now, a harbinger of death, typically unseen by humans.  The exception to this rule is her best friend, who sees her and communicates with her regularly.  One day, he asks if he can watch her in action as a harbinger.  But even watching Ashley do her thing does not change the fact that she is his best friend.This whole thing was a little on the deceptive side.  This book is labled as a novella.  When going on word count, a novella is usually between 10,000 and 40,000 words.  There is no way this was a novella.  I am not even sure it was a novelette, most likely it was just a short story.  And to even get to the short story, the plot of which I describe above, one must first read an excerpt from a full length novel.  However, the excerpt is not, in my opinion, presented in a way that makes me want to read the novel, it is presented in a way that makes this whole ""novella"" confusing.Posting excerpts in ebook form and calling them a free book download is somewhat surreptitious if you ask me.  And I see it becoming a big trend on sites that support various e-readers.  It tends to be ill received by those who do download and read the book.  Sure, free is free, but when you are doing it to promote a book people need to pay for, you are somewhat shooting yourself in the foot.  There are better, more forthcoming ways to do this that do not alienate a reader.  Write a prequal.  Or in this case, write a really good novella, an actual novella, and put the excerpt at the END of the ebook, not the beginning.It made me sad that this turned out to be so disappointing.  Both the short story and the excerpt did seem to have a lot of promise, but the whole experience of the book being not what it purported to be just sort of pushed me away as a reader.",A sneaky piece of advertising,1303948800,2,2,3,0

"Marina has always lived a life on the road with her scientist father. When he decides she should spend her last year of high school with her aunt in ""regular school"", Marina is not happy. But shortly after she arrives in the pretty beach town strange things start happening. Marina almost drowns twice, and comes face-to-face with a mermaid. Maybe this year won't be so boring after all.This is a very sweet story. There is surprisingly a lot of action, mixed in with very unique characters. Marina's cousin Cruz is definitely quirky and lovable. He is a fashion designer in training, and is delightful to meet. His exuberance and energy leap off the page and left me smiling everytime he entered the scene.I found Marina's closed nature and difficulty in opening up to and accepting help from her family and friends very frustrating. It made sense based on her lifestyle and experiences growing up with her father, but it was still very frustrating.I was confused about the family structures present. There were no two parent families, only single parent families, with the missing parent either dead or run off. Everyone was in this situation, and it just seemed a little extreme. I was also concerned with the cluelessness and absense of the existing parents. Marina's father was easy to accept since he was on the other side of the world, but the rest of them? You would think that all those single parents would be a little more tuned into the happenings in their children's lives.Overall, this was sweet and unique story. The mermaids were not quite what I expected, in a good way, and the storyline itself was different and fresh. This is a story that will appeal to a variety of ages.",Very sweet YA story,1316044800,7,7,3,0

She has been a lone hunter trying to keep her secret from her best friend. After a night at a new club Shanna decides to join The Agency. It's a secret organization of hunters of multiple species headed by a woman named Valor. Shanna must learn to hunt along side other hunters and stay alive at the same time.The author features many of the different characters point of views throughout the book. I thought this way a nice touch. Although there were times when I got confused with so many different characters and they are all different types of hunters. We get a little background information about them but not much. I am interested in knowing more about Valor, Shanna and Damien. I also liked that there are different species... vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, witches, demons, etc. There is a lot of action, some romance and suspense.Overall a good book.

She could still be Ethan's girlfriend but here she is wonder woman who takes any kind of wound possible and jumps up to save the day.

In this story, the heroine is B.She was introduced as a confident doctor, then had a really traumatic experience. You would think that confidence and fight shown in the beginning will show and helped her overcome especially when the source of her fear is eliminated but no, she is still playing the victim to the end.

Very talented author and her content is not overly sexualized.  The protagonist in this story was lovable enough, but a little foolish too.  She seemed very immature.

The story was so compelling that I was hooked and kept looking forward to picking it back up when life made me put it down. Have no fear, midway through you begin to grasp the characters and the author binds them all together.

"The first part of this short Novella was interesting, very much an early England type of mystery.  Then in the middle a VERY detailed sexual encounter between the two main characters?????  This was almost insisted upon by the innocent female photographer who throughout the rest of this short story was the class conscious, shy young lady set upon by phantoms and begging for assistance from men of course.  Then we are off to discover and defeat the bad guy back in prim and proper old English style.  Having an encounter much less graphic between the Lord and this young lady would have fit much better to style and effort; after all this was to have taken place in 1855.  Just did not make sense at all given the attempt to copy old style England and their stiff (pardon the pun) views of life, women's place therein and class consciousness. It was written well othewsise and that is why I gave this 3 stars instead of 2.",What was the author thinking???,1303948800,2,2,3,0

"My Rating: 3 stars: Liked it - recommend (B)The prologue of this short story read like a fantastic action movie - the kind that are labeled ""summer blockbuster."" I LOVED the concept of dragons coming forth and decimating civilization. This created a post-apocalyptic setting without the usual politcal causes.Fast-forward several generations and civilization is bleak. Humans and Crossbreeds tribes live in primitive settings built from what is left in the greater-Los Angles area. We don't have much time to learn about Rhone and his tribe, because right from the beginning he is captured and tortured by rival tribe leader Nyx.Nyx is simply a cruel, power-hungry Crossbreed. He rules with an iron fist, fostering fear among his own tribe. Ketta, Nyx's sister (a rare Crossbreed female), is tired of her brother's evil and believes Rhone was sent to free them all and bring peace. She helps him escape and the pair get help from Ketta's grandfather, Arwin.In spite of its shortened length, High Above is packed with action and excitement. It was fairly entertaining throughout, and the romance was passionate. The story had all the moving parts you'd expect - interesting plot, exciting setting, evil bad guy you love to hate, romance, action, and a happy ending. There were no major moral conflicts or overly dramatic moments to incite a deep emotional reaction, although there was one shocking moment that took me by surprise.Unfortunately, because of its length, I felt there were places in the book that needed more which would have created a more fulfilling story. I wanted to know why Rhone could awaken Daisy (no spoilers here). I would have liked more time to develop the trust between Rhone and Arwin and learn more about Rhone's history and tribe. However, it is a novella and there just wasn't space to answer all of my questions.Overall, this is an enjoyable novella-length fantasy story. It's perfect for an afternoon getaway from life. I hope that Ms. Freeman expands upon this exciting world in future works.",Exciting new world in Short Story format,1326412800,0,0,3,0
"This is an extremely short story (only 30 KB) and it lacks the key elements that would make it believable.  It is all about a serial killer but he is not a credible character.  His first victim is a female so intoxicated that she is thrown out of a bar for urinating on the floor.  The killer then takes her back to his apartment where she consumes MORE alcohol YET is still able to converse coherently?  Seriously?  The murders are not committed neatly enough to believe that he continues without being caught as the story insists that he does.  There are too many aspects of the story that are simply counter-intuitive.  There is no naturally plausible scene that would make this a truly chilling and delightfully creepy thriller.  One must truly ignore all the logistical and forensic impossibilities and there are MANY.  Suspension of disbelief is truly tested with this story.  On a positive note, it did end with an unexpected twist and oddly enough - that unexpected twist could be the only plausable occurrence in the story.

"I have to confess, for once a book jarred me out of the suspension of disbelief. The author started well, compelling setting, the two protagonist I found were very interesting, I wanted to read more of them, and the set up for the invasion went well.Then they appear to do something extremely noble, yet it was ill thought out. Their insistence of evacuating children only would make sense IF they were going to turn them over to someone else they knew and trusted to take care of them or if the two protagonist were going to look after them.Part of the point of '-women- and children first' is not just a sexiest chauvinism towards women. Someone has to take care of the children (and it could be a man, I'm not against that). Just picking them up and dumping them somewhere you think safe isn't so noble in the long term. That's reckless.I wouldn't have minded if they were going to turn them over to someone specific or picked up someone they knew would look after the kids. It might have worked if our two heroes were going to look after them, but it didn't seem like it was that kind of book for this latter point.Survival is more than just removing children from danger, they have to be looked after. They aren't just mini-adults who can take care of themselves after being removed from danger. If you have no choice, sure, yes do that. But they had a choice and made a point, several times, of making their ill thought out choice under the guise of nobility and doing the right thing.It as a real shame. I wanted to get to know the two characters well, but I could not get over that point. I even skipped ahead and still it plagued me. Some will find that point a minor one that could easily be ignored. I couldn't.One of the times I just could not finish a book that had engaged me. I see there are more in the series and I wish the author well. I might even try to plow back into book one some day because that jarring point had little to do with the plot as far as I could tell.I just couldn't re-engage my suspension of disbelief beyond this point.",One minor point that was major for me,1333411200,0,0,3,0

"I am a fan of Nicole Williams so when I found out this book was free on amazon I dove right in. Let me start of saying that I LOVE the immortal world Williams has created, it's different from anything else I've read and I honestly don't like overused story lines.I honestly was really iffy about this story while reading the first half of this book for a few different reasons. Bryn seemed really whiny to me in the beginning and she was utterly clueless about things going on around her. It's like she acted as if things that were going on were normal when they really weren't. Also, whenever William's brother Patrick is introduced and he starts to show odd signs to Bryn as if he has feelings for her it got too Twilight like for me. It was Bella, Edward, and Jacob all over again, but maybe I just was misreading his signs? Other than that I really enjoyed how all of the main characters in this book are really well rounded and very interesting. It had that one character that you loved, the one that you got frustrated with, and the evil villain that you absolutely despise. The plot was really well rounded too, I don't like having to wait around for some action to happen and it seemed like there was action almost right away! I also like how it was an insta-love in disguise for Bryn. Read the book and you'll understand what I mean! I was laughing at some parts and angry at others but it's the books that make me feel something that I like the best. Over all I really enjoyed this book and recommend you check it out. It's free on amazon, so if you have a kindle it wouldn't hurt to check it out. (:P.S. If you do read this book and enjoy it, The Glassheart Chronicles is also free on amazon and the last chapter of the book is William and Bryn meeting but from Williams point of view.

"I gave this book 3 stars because I didn't hate it, it just lacked a lot of things and really should be a 1 star.  The star rating seems to be about feeling and not really about the writing, plot,character build, depth etc. This was like grown folk story time hour.  Not the work of a literary giant by any means. Throughout the book I felt like I was in a barbershop listening to old geezers tell lies about their conquests and accomplishments.  The story lines are not well developed and it feels like the writer tosses in stuff because there is another page to fill up.  Absolutely no build up or background.  It is entertaining, but lacks depth.  The writer may be better suited to write little love stories rather than attempt to do books that require more in depth research on the workings of the FBI, law enforcement, psychology etc.Here are some questions that swirled in my head for 10 seconds before I moved on to the next fantastic thing in the book:1. Did the page where Greg became the acting sheriff fall out of my Kindle?  How (and when)did that process take place?2. Bo and Greg finds a skeleton of baby in the walls of the building they own and this is passed off as a non event, but suddenly there is this memorial that is televised by, get this, CNN!  Are you kidding me???  At the memorial there is no mention of the press being there, not even the local press, but the entire thing is televised by CNN.  Moving right along...3. Then the ingots miraculously turned into money!  They must have because they were sitting on the bank's table and then suddenly Callie had all this money in her bank account because the people who were paid with the ingots gave her back the money.

"Well, I couldn't read the first one without reading the trilogy. Tori,the middle McKenzie, is this novels female. Like the first book, I wanted to like it...but I couldn't. I couldn't because it was the same book. There was the rich guy, the girl from the wrong  side of the tracks, and a father with flaws and irritation between the father and son. The author was even wrong about the setting. Please tell me where, within an hour of Beaumont, Texas, there are rolling hills,wide expansive cattle and horse ranches. That scenery would be more of the hill country of Texas, but it doesn't exist in Southeast Texas. Mesquite trees grown in west Texas. The author didn't do her homework on this setting. My other problem was the incessant wordiness. The book could have had half the words and still made the story readable. What would take any other author a page to describe a feeling, a place, a person....take this author a chapter or more. This couple, like the first book, are in and out of love more than necessary.

There was only one thing missing from her existence, and that was a personal life, and love.  Her one true love had been stripped away from her six long years ago, and to this day she still felt the acute pain of losing her husband Paul Benate.  Jo knew she should try to move on; give her heart a push to meet someone new, but she just couldn't do it.Paul wasn't dead as everyone assumed he was.  He had cut Jolene out of his life because he was working on classified projects, and he was terrified that someone would use her to get to him, so he had taken that possibility away.  He did keep tabs on his beautiful wife, and knew she hadn't moved on with someone else just the same as he hadn't.  When he could stand it no longer, he decided to have her brought to the current military complex he was working in.  Someone trying to get to him had shot her, and it was time he started protecting what was his.Jolene was abducted from her protection detail, and was being shipped to someone.  She had no idea what was going on, but decided that keeping a cool head would be her best line of defense.  She had to pay attention, so she could find an opportunity to escape.  Nothing could have shocked her more than coming face to face with the husband she had mourned for years.  She almost lost it, but reigned herself in, and took the only course of action she could at the moment.  Jo resorted to violence, and punched the husband she thought was lost.Paul is a man that was forced to live with a decision he wished with his soul he could change.  He knew he never should have given up his heart's desire in favor of what he wanted to accomplish professionally.  Jolene had existed without Paul for years, but never recovered from his loss.

"I finished reading Deal With The Devil today and honestly, I am not overly thrilled with the story.  Deal With The Devil is an interesting story about how young werewolf Luz Velez overcomes her tormented past and accepts the tall and dangerous vampire Jude Jacobson.The story is written through the eyes of Luz and at times you tend to forget that she is supposed to be 27. Her character is very naive and innocent, though the later is not her fault. You learn throughout the story that the character of Luz was abused as a child. I found it difficult to read. I felt that the extent of her abuse was rather intense to have in a ""romance"" novel. I will give the author Evangeline Anderson credit and admit the issue of abuse was handled well in respect to not rushing the sexuaas relationship of the main characters, but the extent of the abuse did not make for light reading.I found Luz's relationship with her parents aswell as her older sister to also be rather uncomfortable. At the age of 27, Luz was still having a very dysfunctional, confusing, mentally abusive relationship with her family. The fact that she felt it was ok to go to her parents house for dinner (to the people that allowed.....yes! allowed Luz to be raped at 13!) because her mum offered to make her chocolate cake made for some twisted reading! This is a 27 year old!It was hard to read a book that constantly swung between an abused, socially inept young woman and a woman experiencing passionate love for the first time.

"After a long introduction about the downfall of the horror novel, how few horror stories they are left, and how this book had ""real, haunting horror"", I was preparing myself for a collection of really stellar, frightening short stories, and instead I got... well, while none of them are what I would call poorly written, they also aren't what I would call particularly memorable or scary in the slightest. Nearly every story herein is some sort of ghost story, but it's less ""The Grudge"" and more ""here are some ghosts, they have some unfinished business, but they're trapped, sorta, and that's sad I guess?"" It should be said, naturally, that horror is entirely subjective, and what one person finds scary another will find boring, but all of the stories within Ashes don't actually seem to be trying to be scary, unless all of the writers have some sort of different definition of the word than I do.The problem with most of them is that they seem to lack any real point... there is rarely any sort of resolution, usually only a sort of token conflict, and most of them just kind of peter out with an ""oh well"" sort of vibe. One story, revolving around a pregnant woman abandoned on a farm, actually felt pointless, confusing, and downright silly to the point where I actually went back over it to see if I was missing something, or if a few pages had stuck together. Ashes makes for an entertaining read if you're looking to pass the time and relax for a few minutes, but there isn't much substance here, ghostly or otherwise.",Lacks Spirit,1307232000,4,4,3,0

"I could easily be talked into giving this four stars for its high adventure, intriguing mystery and appealing characters.

""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist.

"Rachel Vincent's Reaper is an interesting story that explains how Tod becomes a reaper. While the story is moving and interesting, I felt that it fell short in a number of areas. I enjoyed the TV series Dead Like Me quite a bit, and I didn't see much here that was different from that series. Vincent mentions that Tod and his family (and another character that appears later) are 'bean sidhe', but while this is an interesting detail, it goes nowhere in this story. Surprisingly, as difficult as it must be for Tod to become a reaper, I really felt that it lacked emotional punch. Finally, Tod's new 'boss' outlines some pretty serious consequences, if Tod screws up, but Tod goes right out and breaks the rules, and nothing happens. There's an explanation for this, but it just feels weak. The best parts of this story are the actual plot and Tod's general attitude.I've heard about the series, and I keep up with a lot of the YA series (I'm a high school teacher), but I don't think this is the best introduction.

Here are 25 recipes for different kinds of chocolate chip cookies that will have your mouth watering.I love chocolate chip cookies, so when I saw this book was available for free as a kindle download, it only made sense for me to get it.  I am not entirely sure how I feel about using an ebook reader for a cookbook.  I often want my recipes in the kitchen with me, and there is no way I would use my kindle in the kitchen, and run the risk of getting food or liquid on it.

Neither method seems efficient, and I think I personally would rather have a cookbook in my hands.  Who cares if it gets some stains on it?As far as the recipes go, many of them sound good, and are variations of old favorite recipes.

"While the Dr. Thorndyke series is pretty obviously a Sherlock Holmes take off, that's OK, when they work. I do find myself thinking ""Again? Does everyone in the book except Thorndyke have to be a blustering idiot?"" But so it goes.There are some I like and some that I just get through and I've realized that what makes the difference is the narrator.It takes a while to realize it, but Thorndyke as a character really plays a fairly minor role in these mysteries. He seems like the central character but he is always just observed (ala the Holmes series) and we are never privy to his thoughts, except when he voices them, though they are all first-person narratives.And there lies the rub: If I like the narrator, I enjoy the story, and if not, I don't. The first several I read had Dr Jervis as the narrator and I liked him. But then there was the one who was another young doctor in love, and he was simpering beyond belief, as though Freeman just doesn't know how to portray men interested in women without making them cloying.This story seems to me the weakest, for a couple of reasons. First, once again the narrator falls in love and simpers, which is especially unattractive in a male. Then, to follow the ""everyone but Thorndyke is an idiot"" motif, this time the narrator is the lawyer who always acts for Thorndyke and has for years, and thus there's no reason for him to respond to the way everyone else does to Thorndyke's near-omniscience. But true to form, this one, Anstey, is as dense both in general, and about Thorndyke, as the rest.I use these as subway reading, but if they cost more than a buck or two, I'd toss them.",Not one of the better Thorndykes,1355097600,1,1,3,0

I liked the premise of the story and was interested to see how he would go about a vampire romance tale.It was a fairly quick read and easy to follow. Although at times it was a little awkward reading the dialogue and the story progression. The main character can be likable but annoying at the same time. You do eventually realize why she is acting that way, but a bit more character description and explanation in the beginning would have helped the issue.He has created a vampire world that you do not fully get introduced to in this first novel. But leaves plenty for you to learn in following stories. So far though its a great mix of classic myths and modern changes. I like how hes vampires are not comfortable with modern technology if they were turned in an earlier time period.I want to know more about Mike and how he became a vampire and his uncle and what the history is there. I also want to know more about the best friend Debbie. She seems to have some interesting abilities.

"Fans of Meg Cabot's Heather Wells books will find fun and leisure in this fun Kindle set. Maddie Springer is a likeable and hilarious heroine, with a fondness for fast food and a weakness for high heels. Jack Ramirez is a tough talking detective with a fondness for order and a weakness for curvy blondes. When these two meet fireworks explode. Sometimes you want to slap Maddie for her antics, but you'll fall in love with her all the same - something Ramirez completely identifies with.Absolutely loved these romantic mystery books. They are light, funny, beach reads. They aren't going to rock your world or make you think too deeply. Perfect for reading after working on your thesis, or an exhausting day at the office. Personally, I read these books while recovering from a serious accident and they totally took my mind off the pain I was experiencing. They will make you laugh, and almost any pushing 30 (or slightly after) gal will identify with the hilarious heroine. Worth the read.",Lighthearted Fun Beach Reads,1351555200,1,1,3,0

"Silver Moon is just one of the few novella's that I have read, and the second manuscript from Thompson-Geer. The first of which I found very difficult to read due the abundance of spelling and grammatical errors.Though in Silver Moon there were much less mistakes, I still recommend Ms. Thompson-Geer seriously consider looking into obtaining a second editor. The story however was by far more enjoyable than I expected, and I would have liked to see it as a stand alone novel.With so many books being written today about vampires, werewolves, and witches, it is not easy to come up with an interesting storyline or unique character's, but Silver Moon does pretty well. I saw a little of Anita Blake, Cassie Palmer, and Rachel Morgan, as well as their male counterparts, which, for me at least was just fine.Rose finds herself in front of the vampire council. Though she herself could due without the council, she takes a ""job"" to help capture a rogue were. She is aided by Bobbie; a witch, and another werewolf.There is sexual tension, betrayal, and love.

"ABOUT THE BOOK:Journalist Eve Newman stumbles across the murder of a prominent member of her west Texas town and finds herself the target of a shadowy killer. When the body goes missing and the police don't believe she saw it happen, she turns to the only man in town she can trust; her deceased brother's best friend.Former Marine, Macklin Quinn, has been half in love with Eve since they were kids, but he's always considered her off-limits. When she turns to him for help he can't send her away. Within twenty-four hours it's clear she's in trouble and someone wants her dead. Mac will do everything in his power to keep the feisty journalist alive and help her bring down the killer. And if they can stay alive long enough, he'll do whatever it takes to convince her they're meant to be together.REVIEW:This book held my attention - but unfortunately it was held by the romantic aspect alone.  The plot, while interesting, seemed a bit excessive.  I think it is a good read, but I'd be happy at seeing something a little more believable.The characters Eva and Mack were lovely to see and I wish there could have been more of them.  I liked the background Ms. Reus gave to them and found myself wishing they'd get together as well.The writing seemed to have extra words, some of which could have been taken out and made the story stronger.  I do look forward to watching Ms. Reus grow as a writer and can't wait to see what she comes up with next.3 out of 5 stars for a nice, quick read.",Nice romantic story,1341532800,0,0,3,0
"This was a pretty good, enjoyable introduction to the Werewolves of Malta series. We dived right in to the potential mating between Bruno and Renee. Bruno is an alpha who knows what he wants who recognizes the power that Renee holds. He knows that a mating between them could bring their Pack power but he has to challenge the current Pack leader. Renee has been burned by alphas before; her father is trying to sell her to an older mate so she's reluctant to believe that Bruno wants to become mates. There is an undeniable spark between them that draws them together and heat when they finally come together. I had only a few issues with this story. Again, I felt it was a little short; there was a lot of potential for a longer story. I also wasn't that big of a fan of the fact that Renee was only 20.

"I liked the Joker's Wild series...but this was my least favorite out of the three. All of the guys in these stories have ""issues"" (who doesn't? LOL) but the main character here seemed rather disconnected, critical and just an odd man. Brody is described as drop dead gorgeous while Missy is a self-conscious, ""larger,"" woman a few years Brody's junior. The point about Brody being upset when Missy would make fun of herself and Brody's refusal to deal with it was mentioned so many times I grew tired of it. And I never really ""got"" why these two people became a couple. This one had less romantic attraction (in the beginning) than the other two in the series--it was more based on sexual attraction.

But all is not well in the Duvall home and evil in on the menu.I would call this a basic ""good vs evil"" horror story but no one in this tale is good. Each has a past of which they are ashamed and each has reasons they don't want that past to be revealed.The tree, a protagonist in its own right, is never explained in a way we can understand. It simply is evil for no reason other than being evil. The other protagonists, other than Duvall, are flat and at least in one case, boring. The most interesting character, was the young boy whose personality developed too late in the story for him to have much impact.""The Devil Tree"" left me feeling like I had read a horror book in search of a literary award. It was slow and sluggish due to the over use of similes and metaphors, the repetition of information and the addition of meaningless characters that added nothing to the plot.

"This is a short novella (more of a short story than a novella) about Amarrah and her desire to retrieve an old box she was given for safekeeping that was stolen from her 10 years earlier.  The story starts off with Amarrah at 13 in Iraq when she received the box from her Grandmother and we then see it get taken from her.  The story picks up 10 years later when she sees the box on TV.  She tracks down the box and goes to retrieve it.  The story also switched back and forth from Amarrah's past life to the present day.  While the previous life story was interesting and added to the main story, since the book was so short, it ended up detracting from the development of the main story.  The main action happens in less than 1 day and I just couldn't believe that the characters connected so much in less than a day (even given the circumstances I won't spoil). There were a lot of unanswered questions (who was after the box, why was it special, etc). I haven't read any of this author's books before but it was well written.  If you plan on reading the trilogy that this book is setting up, then I would say read it.

"I almost overlooked the Amazon listing for this book when I came to review it because the cover was changed.  The previous cover was a nerdy bit of fun that clearly suggested that there was a lot of fannish parody inside.  The current one seems to have nothing to do with the book.  To make it clear, the book did not have a shirtless guy standing in front of what looks like Christmas tree lights.  I liked the other cover better, but I think the current one is less likely to entice people into thinking that the book is a well written satire of certain popular television shows-- because it isn't. It tries to be but falls shortThe ebook is about 100 pages, 139kb. It was originally part of an anthology calledTripping through the Universepublished by New Concepts in 2005.  I would suggest that a potential reader download the sample before buying.  If the idea of a person from a culture (the author calls it a species) which regards clothes as an abomination is called a Noo'dis't doesn't make you roll your eyes and clutch your ereader really tight so you don't heave it at the nearest wall, then it is probably safe to read the rest of the story.The hero is a rather dim womanizing star ship captain who by ignoring a red flag the size of Mars and staring too hard at the Noo'dis't's blue bits gets himself booted off his ship along with his second in command, who might be fun if she didn't inexplicably have the hots for the dim womanizer.As I said in the title, humor is subjective and this just didn't amuse me.",Humor Is Subjective,1276387200,4,4,3,0

"The Father's Child by Mark Adair is a techno-thriller that is jam-packed with twists and turns. John Truman is just an average guy, or at least he seems to be. The book opens with your average college party and John is not the party type. After hiding out for as long as he can, he slowly tries making his way downstairs to blend in among friends. Only things take a wild turn and masked men decide to crash the party. Armed with serious weaponry, they demand that one of John's close friends, George, step forward or else. Deciding to give himself up rather than see anyone hurt, George agrees and is taken by the masked men, who then leave just as quickly as they came.Years later, John and another good friend Paul have decided to move and start over. Deciding they should go ahead with the original plans, they want to open their own company. Only John starts having weird dreams and appears to be borderline psychotic. Being able to create complicated computer programs, John sets out on a search to track George's last steps before he was taken feeling as though he owes it to George to find the truth. Little does he know at the time, but John's whole life has been planned out for him and he is to become part of the New Dawn.This book took me a little while to get into it. The beginning starts off great with a lot of action and then there are several chapters where Mr. Adair is laying the ground work, setting up the story and giving the readers details that will be needed later in the story, although there are a couple of spots where there is a little action. On more than one occasion I found myself pushing this book to the side and coming back to it. Once you get through the beginning, it does pick up if you stay with it.The Father's Child is a book with two point of views. Each chapter alternates between John and Paul and I found this to be a little bit distracting. I would just be getting comfortable reading the story from one view only to have it abruptly switched to another. John and Paul may be best friends but they have very different personalities and therefore different ways of telling the story.",Full of Twists and Turns,1305849600,4,4,3,0

"This free Kindle download is a short story by the romance author Robyn Carr.  I have seen her name on books over the years but had never read anything by her so it seemed like a good opportunity to do so at no cost to me.  In addition, it's written specifically to highlight the Zoe Institute (located in Oklahoma) and all the good work it does to support single mothers.  The support isn't just food, diapers, shelter, etc. but includes workshops and classes to teach life skills and rebuild self-esteem for women who have left abusive relationships.  Not only did I get the chance to read a short story at no cost, I learned more about this wonderful institution and the work it does.  This short story is just one of five that are included in the ""More Than Words, Volume 6"" book with the other stories written by different authors.Commenting on the work itself (and separating it from the commendable purpose for which it was written) - the short story is long enough that it has time to develop characters, relationships and situations the reader can relate to and care about.  Fairly typical of this type of writing, what you see is what you get, but it is still enjoyable and a good, light read.  A message about the struggles of single moms, particularly battered women is front and center which does mean it definitely isn't all starshine throughout.If you enjoy Robyn Carr or Debbie Macomber-style books, you will probably enjoy this one.

"The premise of the book was great but I unfortunately found the romance in this book to be slightly unbelievable, at least on Grant's side. Perhaps unbelievable is the wrong word. A better description would be distant, in that I wasn't really sucked into it. Grant just was too calm and calculating about the whole thing, and it made it very hard to believe that he actually loved Delia. Love is something that is supposed to be all consuming, not something you weight the pros and cons of. I admired Delia's strength and restraint in keeping her heart hidden from him in order to stay an individual and not just another possession in his collection. She fell almost immediately head over heels for him, and while he offered everything she could have dreamed of, she stands strong. Having his heart means more than anything else possibly could, and she wouldn't accept anything less than his love.Putting the almost one sided relationship aside, I enjoyed the book, especially how well fleshed out the characters and world were. The stone statues were probably the best aspect of the book as they added large amounts of comic relief. The fantasy aspect adds a nice touch to book without detracting from the main theme of romance between Delia and Grant. The book is definitely worth reading just for Delia's side, as she is a very strong and interesting character. I also found the ""villain"" to be both realistic and a very believable threat. I look forward to reading more from this author as this was a good new entry in to the paranormal romance genre.

"J. R. Rain's Dark Horse introduces readers to Jim Knighthorse, a former college football player with a drinking problem, a bum knee, and a quick wit. Knighthorse is hired by a defense attorney to investigate the murder of a beautiful white high school student whose black boyfriend has been arrested. The local cops (who are exceedingly dumb even by the standards of PI book cops) feel they have an open-and-shut case despite the fact there is no evidence other than the murder weapon which was planted in the boyfriend's car.This is a fairly short book and Rain keeps the story moving, with a couple of unfortunate major distractions. The mystery itself comes together fairly nicely, and Knighthorse dispenses some extralegal justice along the way. However, Rain juggles several subplots that don't work. His primary subplot is a local homeless man who hangs out at MacDonalds, has long talks with Knighthorse, and claims to be God. The two have several encounters in the book, and Rain plays it seriously, but his efforts at theology and metaphysics just don't work.The time wasted on this plot thread, along with ones about an inept hit man and the murder of Knighthorse's mother (which will apparently be resolved in future books), make this book seem padded and distract from the main storyline, without really adding much to character development. As a result, I can't fully recommend the book, but it does give readers hope that subsequent Knighthorse novels will either drop the extraneous story lines or make them work better.",Interesting Story with DIstracting Subplots,1385510400,0,0,3,0
"When I first started reading this short story, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I read the description again, because it's been a while since I downloaded this as a free-for-the-Kindle-story. It's fairly entertaining and based on Greek mythology, but I think the story could have been developed a bit more because it seemed rushed.Pinkie is a teenager who stands in the middle of a road and won't let Noah or any tourists or passers-by continue on.  Noah is angry and tries to get around Pinkie, but he winds up nose-diving into the ditch and the only car repair or body shop around is the one near Noah's accident. Pinkie, the sheriff and the car repair business owner are all crooks and are out to scam Noah for as much money as they can possibly get from him, but Noah's father won't pay the outrageous amount of money they want for the repairs, so Noah is on his own.In the meantime, Noah finds and tries to help several beached whales on the shore and meets up with the annoying Pinkie again.  Noah's mother shows up as well as his father at the body shop, and here the story takes a twist, and one of the beached whales saves the day.The mythology angle is very interesting, and I think it could have been developed a little more to add more to that aspect of the story.

"I thoroughly enjoyed ME, MYSELF AND WHY?, so thought this short little prequel would be a fun, entertaining read.  Well, it's definitely short, and it was free, so I guess I can't complain.  I actually did chuckle a little - I mean, a guy at a speed dating event talking about his experience with a woman with multiple personalities should be funny, right?

This book was not terrible by any means and there were some parts of it i enjoyed like the world they were in after the apocalypse and the description of the life women and prostitutes lead in general was quite candid and realistic.  The problem that i have with the book that degraded it to a 3 star read is the story was too short.....the shortness of it didn't allow the author enough time to pull the story together in such a way to leave a lasting impression on us the readers.  The idea and the vision was there and in some parts especially in the begining when the heroine describes her life was very intriging.  But towards the end the story fizzles out and leaves a bad after taste in your mouth.  so for me it was just ok.,uhh could have been better....,1328572800,0,0,3,0
"In ""No Time Left,"" we meet Frank  Becker, David Baldacci's main character, standing in front of a ""modern"" building in a city ""that had seen more prosperous days.""Becker is of ""average features"" and is someone who blends into the pale landscape by virtue of ""the bland suits he wore, the low decibels of his speech, his everyman's attention to any location other than him."" His line of work allows no room for empathy. Compassion is not constructive. To Becker, feeling conveys weakness. If he has a distinguishing characteristic, it's that he was born without an index finger on his right hand.With little time to build character or tension, short stories must be difficult to write. This one reads as if Baldacci was preoccupied with something else. He seems intent on making ""No Time Left"" as plain and unprepossessing as possible. And then at the last minute he pitches the curve ball that comes fast out of nowhere and is meant to hit with a shock.  Except it doesn't. Unlike some of his better efforts - ""Stone Cold"" comes to mind - this time out Baldacci fails to engage. ""No Time Left"" is simply plain and unprepossessing.",Everyman going nowhere,1307404800,1,1,3,0
"The Prince is a nice addition to The Selection series. We get a brief glimpse of how Maxon sees the whole ordeal and what he feels about it.Maxon was the same Maxon we all love from The Selection and The Elite. I don't really feel like I know him better. If anything, I feel like his portrayal in the first two books was well done. Miss Cass has already communicated his personality very well.It was interesting to see all of his insecurities when it came to the Selection. Of course, who came blame the poor guy for getting nervous? 35 chicks were coming to live in the same building. Yes, it's huge. But still, the palace has been his home all his life and now they're invading.The one thing that did surprise me was how much he wanted to please his father and seemed to love him. I expected him to be a little more resentful or angry.My favorite parts had to be Maxon's interactions with America. I was really eager to see those first few through his eyes.

I didn't think it was as bad as Dear Author did and since I'm not up on my Arthurian history, I'll leave that alone.I just plain didn't like the heroine, Elsbeth.  I thought she was a whiny little princess whose endless rant of ""Give me my freedom"" got really tiresome, given she had no other place to go, the treatment of women in those times and her privileged status in the household.Ms. Sullivan did evoke the sights, sounds and smells of the Dark Ages and the writing itself was very good.

"Rated 3 out of 5 White Roses.Jenny MacDonald knows that Jason Colby is nothing more than a con artist. He may have fooled the whole town into thinking he's a saint but she knows better! He's the man responsible for her husband's death. It doesn't matter if the way he acts is contrary to how her husband described him. His kindness is not fooling her! Neither is his good looks...Jason knows what kind of a man he is and he knows that he doesn't deserve a woman like Jenny MacDonald. He just can't let her know the truth about her husband and how he really died. The fact that he wants Jenny has no bearing on the situation, he can't have her. His past will never let him have the future he really wants.Now here's my humble opinion...Even though I liked this story, I still couldn't help but get aggravated with our hero. He wants to be with Jenny, he technically is with Jenny but he can't keep her. His stubborn attitude bordered on the ridiculous. In fact, if he simply shared the truth with Jenny when he had the opportunity it would have saved them both a lot of heartache and trial. It woudl have also saved the reader, that is me, from constantly thinking, ""Are you serious, man?"" But if he had done that, then we, the readers, would be left without a story.Colby's Child was still pleasant and even had touching moments where I felt the pain of the characters in the story. It just focused so much on Jenny wanting to make a relationship between them work while Jason kept putting her off and not giving her a real reason why beyond that she deserved better. The truth, when it was revealed, made me think, ""That's it? That's the reason you pushed the love of your life away?""

"This short little novella picks up where The Iron King left off, with Meghan going off with ash to the Unseelie court. From what I understand people who don't read this and just pick up book two get confused because they feel like they've missed part of the story. I can't tell you if that's true or not since after I'm done typing this I'm going to go start The Iron Daughter, I just happened to notice that this one was published first. The majority of the story is traveling to the Unseelie court and trying to escape the Hunter. There isn't a whole lot going on and in fact at least half is summing up what happened in The Iron King, which is frustrating. Honestly I hope that Meghan is not like she is in this novella in the next book because she was a bit too whiny for my liking. I know she's just sixteen but the ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" bit gets old fast.

I would also like to find out more about Troy and how he assimilates into the new world he is being given the opportunity to join.Overall it's a nice little bite of the authors writing.

"Bad Apple has the potential to be a really good story but it just doesn't deliver - and I really wanted it to. The writing was very stunted and erratic. Half the time I had no idea who was talking and I never had an opportunity to really get to know the characters. There is no intimacy with them for me whatsoever. I feel like I was hearing about people third or fourth hand.The concept of the story was good. There is a real potential to be a smart, emotional and intriguing plot. A plot that could capture the reader and pull them along for sequels, in fact. However, there are some changes that would have to be made and perhaps some different outcomes. The story seemed rather rushed, and this has led to a rather short and choppy novel. It seems that the author intends to continue the story, though, I'm not certain where it will go as things were wrapped up so quickly with the antagonist.I sincerely hope the author considers reworking this one. It could be so much more than it is presently. I would definitely re-read it if that were to happen because as I stated, the concept is incredibly good. I waffled between 2 and 3 stars but I had to go with 2 on GR because OK is how I felt about it. It would probably be a 3 on most of the other sites pending on what the stars meant.

I would have been very interested in seeing this as a longer novel because the back story was very interesting.  I would have loved to have the whole story behind the shooting that killed Kendall's partner.Rating: 3 starsI liked this book, but because it was so short, it was hard to really get into the story and connect with the characters.

I also liked Daphne, she was a fun character to read about.I do think the book was a little too short and could have used some more depth into the characters and the magical world.  Also, the author started a mystery involving Daphne's mom that is just kind of left with no resolution.

"I love stories of women who defy traditional gender roles but novels of female highwaymen are a dime a dozen and a large portion of them aren't worth the time it takes to read the covers. After reading Celia Rees' Sovay, I've avoided these titles like the plague. Still, something about this novella said take a chance.I was pleasantly surprised by The Robber Bride. The characters aren't as polished as I would like but they are charmingly appealing and witty. Almost from thefirst page, I found myself laughing out loud at the surprisingly anecdotes and dialogue.Perhaps this is why I found the plot holes so disappointing. I'm still not clear on exactly how Lady Beecham came by her information nor do I quite understand how Finn was able to find so much support for Victoria when it was the very lack of compassion among her peers that led to her actions in the first place.

"This is the first book I'm reading from Carolyn McCray but I already know I'm going to be reading more. Yet I have intensely mixed feelings about this book; it has the basic elements of a romance novel and it goes way beyond that. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a psychological thriller but if I did, I wouldn't be far off.Regina was married off when she was 16 years old. She has two children and a bully of a husband who she can barely stand. Quinton is an environmentalist hired to do an Environmental Impact Assessment for the logging company owned my Regina's husband.Quinton should be the antithesis of all Regina stands for, with his mixed heritage and his tree-hugging ways, except he's not. Strangely the pair are drawn to each other as Quinton represents a fantasy which has before now, been beyond Regina's reach.In getting to know Regina, Quinton begins to rediscover himself and regains contact with a major part of himself that he'd lost touch with. While all this is going on, life does not stand still.Quinton and his charming assistant, Ralph become implicated in a vandalism case, the townspeople are less than welcoming to the strangers and there's the nearby reservation where Quinton has strained relations, or so he thinks. Not to forget the husband, of course. All in all, there's just so much tension that I couldn't help taking frequent breathers from the book.Generally I can't stand stories that have infidelity in them and that seems to be the main theme in Indian Moon. Forget that Regina was told by the old elder on the reservation that she was not married in her ""heart,"" and the fact that she was also hinted that Wayne, her husband could have maybe broken his vows to her; I'm not sure those are reasons enough to excuse infidelity.One thingIndian Moon: Love Isn't As Far Away As You Think (Real Romance...For the Rest of Us)does is challenge the reader. I certainly found myself shifting uncomfortably as I read and as I found myself being drawn into the lives of Regina and Quinton (and getting to like them to boot); I couldn't help but remember that even though these characters might be fictional, they represented the effects and choices we all take every day.So no, I did not fall in love with Indian Moon; it certainly won't be one of those books I re-read until they fall to pieces (or the Kindle falls to pieces, whichever). However, I did fall in love with the author and will recommend her books, including this one",Engaging But Evokes Mixed Feelings,1342310400,5,5,3,0
"`Wilder's Mate' is the first book in a new paranormal series by Moira Rogers.The paranormal genre is so versatile; it constantly throws me for a loop. Urban fantasy put vampires and werewolves into modern, everyday settings. But many authors are putting an historic twist on the old paranormal tale - Gail Carriger writes about high-society vampires and werewolves in a twisted alternate Victorian-era. Likewise, Lydia Dare has written about werewolves in the 1800's. Moira Rogers has taken the historic spin into a whole new frontier - the Wild West.Roger's new `Bloodhounds' series is set in an alternate mid-western universe. Vampires and their ghouls live in middle-of-nowhere old west townships, in the Deadlands. Bloodhounds, or werewolves, act as sheriffs for these frontier towns, warding off the vampires and maintaining the peace.In `Wilder's Mate', a young weapons apprentice called Satira is desperate to rescue her mentor who has been kidnapped by the vamps for nefarious purposes. Enter Wilder, the Bloodhound assigned to investigate the kidnapping. . .`Wilder's Mate' is `True Grit' and `The Quick and the Dead' meets steampunk paranormal romance. It's a veritable smorgasbord of genres and a delicious new fantasy mixture. If werewolves are your thing, then wait until you read about these rough and tumble old-west werewolves who rule the frontier. Woah!As much as I enjoyed the gun-slinging and rough-riding in this book, the romance stands out for being old-worldly romantic. Satira and Wilder have exchanges that are reminiscent of old movie sirens in classic Western movies. Think Elizabeth Taylor (R.I.P.) in 'Giant' or Jane Russell in 'The Outlaw'. Swoon-worthy scenes that could only work with a Wild West backdrop to heighten the romance and drama;`Wilder's Mate' is a shorter Kindle read than I expected. Because Rogers has come up with such a magnificent old-world western setting, I thought the book would be long enough to delve into the universe and really take readers on a journey through the steampunk frontier. As it is, we only gain bits and pieces about this world from the limited exchanges between Satira and Wilder. We learn that the vampires are the villains of the west, and many people succumb to the lavish lifestyles they promise (the payment for which is your neck and blood). We learn that the women in these times either become wives or whores, and Satira is the daughter of the latter, but she has been determined through her weapons inventions to avoid the same career path. Bloodhounds are strict lawmen who discourage their hounds from taking mates and settling down.I can understand why Moira Rogers perhaps felt she didn't need to go into a lot of explanation about this world. Most readers will have some knowledge of spaghetti-westerns and will be able to picture the frontier universe Rogers is creating without pages and pages of detail. But still, because the old west setting is what makes this series so unique, I do wish there were more specifics.I also wish there was more time taken to nut-out the specifics of the plot. Readers are dropped into the thick of the action, and the book begins when Wilder arrives on his rescue-mission for Satira's mentor. We learn nothing of the actual kidnapping, we are merely there when Satira and Wilder set-out to save the inventor. Once again, this comes down to the book being quite short and sweet, and me wishing there was more page-time for such developments and details.Moira Rogers has invented a wild new frontier setting for the popular werewolf myth. The paranormal genre has been infused with old-world brilliance as Rogers writes about Deadlands vampires and werewolf sheriffs with a healthy dose of steampunk thrown in. I hope the books are longer in the future, because half the appeal of this new series is the setting, and I don't think Rogers gave herself enough page-time to really immerse readers in the old frontier.",Werewolf Wild West,1301011200,0,0,3,0

"Publication Date : May 8, 2011Khensa, a girl from the slums, is one of the last of a dying breed. Farro blood courses through her veins and for it she has suffered countless atrocities. Orphaned, kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured, she endures without knowing if it shall ever end. For eleven months she endures...Enter Bomani, her unintentional savior. Sent by his father to assassinate the high priest, he finds her, bloody, starved, and naked upon the floor. She is feral and half-crazed and yet still he takes her away. He introduces her to a whole new world - his own.Together they navigate their way around a fragile society of kings, vendettas, and magic. Their story crosses deserts and mountains. It begins with fire and ends with water.I had no expectation for this book once I started reading it since I do not read blurbs, the opening scene is depicted as vile and inhuman and therefore Khensa's survival is all the more miraculous and impressive.As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Khensa has little or no idea who or what she is, her powers grows stronger by the hour and with it her ability to charm and enchant, but the love she evokes, the devotion, the friendships are they real or are they result of her enchantment...It is a little boy that loves her unequivocally that grabbed my attention, her attention and devotion to this child was, for me the highlight of the story.The author has a knack for implementing accents within her story to give it more flesh and to add depth; one such an example is the way in which people communicate in the part of town where Khensa grew up.  The whistling is a nice touch and lends some more credibility to a fantastical story.I do feel that the story was at times dragged out too much and the tension between the main protagonists played up a wee bit too much but overall it was a nice read and one I am sure most lovers of the YA paranormal genre will love.WaAr",A nice easy read.,1363564800,0,0,3,0

"When I first read the description of this book I knew I had to read it. As a vampire story lover it was just calling out to be read. I recommend it to any vampire lover out there.This is the first story by Maggie that I have read. It was well written and the story moved along at a fast pace. At times I did think it moved along a little too fast but it definitely did not drag out, which I really liked.I loved Kat and Joe and Nina and Phillip. I thought they were great characters. Well developed and described. I wanted to know more about them and see how their relationships developed. And this is where my only real problem with the book comes in. We really didnt get to see their relationships develop. It was all instant love at first site, overcoming any issues with them being vampires immediately. I would have preferred it to take a bit longer, meaning more than a page or two. And get most character background and development from it.In this one book we get Nina and Phillips story, than Joe and Kat, and then later even Phillips brother. I would have liked it to almost be split into 3 separate books. Each focusing on the pair and their stories. That way we get more character development and feel more of a connection with their relationship seeming more real and lasting.Aside from that one issue though I really did enjoy the story. I hope she writes more soon in this line and we get to find out more about these characters and their lives and backgrounds.

I wasn't captivated by it. I didn't note any real suspense, no creep factor or anything of that sort.

"Since receiving my Kindle, I've read a lot of free and reduced price books, and on the whole, most have been more than worth the price. Edna Curry's ""Dead Man's Image"" fits that category, both in cost (I received a complimentary copy of this book for the purpose of reviewing it) and in quality. Though I love thrillers and mysteries, I would not likely have picked up this Lacey Summers mystery; not only is our main character a woman, but our author is primarily a romance writer. Neither of those facts caused me any real consternation once I got into the story.Ms. Curry introduces our two main characters, long haul trucker Paul Menns and struggling P.I. Lacey Summers in short order. She also quickly lays out our plot, a murder with an obvious case of mistaken identity, since the alleged victim is reading about his death in the newspaper. All this is a good start, but then we spend nearly half of the book stumbling around before we reach our first ""Ah-Ha"" moment. That discovery is almost so revelatory that you wonder how Ms. Curry can finish the story. No need to fear; the plot twists and turns come at a dizzying pace from there forward. In fact, the plot becomes so complicated (convoluted?) that one very important detail is nearly settled as a post script.In addition to the wildly twisting plot, my other complaint is the lack of color Ms. Curry gives us. Much of the scenery, and even the physical descriptions of many of our characters, is left too much up to our own imagination. Some more attention to these details would have been appreciated. As I would assume befits a writer of romance novels, though, Ms. Curry writes a couple of really descriptive love scenes. If she'd have been that descriptive of Lacey Summers herself, I could at least have a mental image of what she looked like.While I mostly enjoyed the book, with so many great (free and reduced price) books out there, I'm fairly sure I won't visit Minnesota to see Lacey Summers again.",Dead Man's Image: A Complicated Image to Be Sure,1308960000,0,0,3,0

This series was to predictable with the same underlying theme in each book. The big strong jock falls the weaker and or older guy at the local gym and live happily ever after. This series is not the high quality series one expects from an author as talented as Mr. Grey.

It was with much anticipation that I looked forward to Penn Sebastians story and I have to say I am so very disappointed. There was ample substance to put out a full length novel about Penn and his HEA as well as the opportunity to write about and bring us up to date on the rest of the crew.  In all honesty, I think Miss Morgan has shortchanged her fanbase with this unsatisfying e-book.  With everything we have learned about Penn and all he has gone through, he more than earned a full length novel.  My feelings are that she no longer wanted to bother as she was moving on to another series of books and she needed to tie up loose ends in the most expedient way.

"In the first of two short stories, ""Forever"", a man named David Scarsdale decides he wants to leave his wife and tells her so.  David and his wife become trapped in a situation that is impossible, but to tell would ruin the story for everyone else.I liked the story and wondered how it would end, but it came to such an abrupt ending that it wasn't very satisfying for me. I was looking forward to a better ending or one that didn't end so abruptly. Although it deals with the supernatural, it wasn't quite believable, as some other stories I've read have been.The second story, ""Twelve Minutes"" is another short story that has an outcome affected by the supernatural.  This story deals with a marriage that is less than perfect, too.  One spouse wants to leave the other, only under odd circumstances.  Again, the twist at the end kind of ruined the story for me.  Since this author's stories have had less than the type of ending I was hoping for, I am hesitant to purchase a novel that he's written.The supernatural is not my favorite kind of short story or novel to read, so that affects my outlook on the stories.

"Sorry but I just lost faith in this book although I did finish it which is why it gets 3 stars and not less.Like another reviewer, I struggled with the plot which became increasingly like a Mills and Boon romance (with a small side order of violence chucked in) than the more serious historical adventure story it set out to be.On the positive side, I loved the detail and thought it went a long way towards bringing occupied Paris to life but that's about where it stopped for me. Michael Wallace is obviously a talented writer and that kept me going long after I'd given up on the storyline.I'd also say that the story rattles along, there are very few editorial errors, the dialogue's not particularly stilted and the sentence structure makes for an easy read. All reasons why this book is worth more than one or two stars.However ...This is the early 40's. France is under the kosh and we're expected to believe that Wehrmacht officers can happily drive from one end of the country to the other without consideration for what they're really supposed to be doing, that a senior Gestapo official can spend time pursuing minor individuals, and that a Jewish (perceived) homosexual would be putting themselves on prominent display in an area frequented by fanatical Nazis.There's also the issue of how one of our heroes just 'makes money' without really seeming to try.I struggled with the ending (will try not to spoil it here) and how someone gets from Paris to Marseille seemingly in the blink of an eye. OK, you can do it in 3-and-a-half hours nowadays but that wasn't so 70 years ago.With the restaurant setting, the (understandably) garbled 'foreign' languages and the slightly ridiculous plot, it all seemed a bit like an extended episode of the BBC comedy series, 'Allo, 'Allo.","'Allo, 'Allo.",1355788800,4,4,3,0

"In many ways this book feels like two half books.  If only the two parts could be reunited with their matching halves you'd end up with a great book and a good book.  As it is you're left with one book that is just okay.Overall Neumyer's writing is very good with appropriate word choice for what I perceive as his target audience (""middle grades"" 8-12 years old with more appeal to boys than girls).  The first half of the book sets up the life of Jimmy Stone and does an excellent job of it.  If there is such a thing as a ""grade schooler coming of age"" story the first half of this book would be an great start.  Several conflicts are established and bringing them to a resolution in the second half would have been excellent.  Of course if you picked this book anticipating a scary ghost story you'd be disappointed.Finally in the second half the ghost story begins.  But this half doesn't seem related to the first half other than Jimmy and his friend David being in both halves.  The second half does nothing to resolve any of the conflicts established in the first half.  Instead it sets up an additional conflict, getting home, with the way to do this being to accomplish a task in each of 7 ""realms,"" the first realm being a world inhabited by ghosts.  The only payoff for accomplishing the first goal is being able to move on to the next realm.  The payoff here seems way too slim.My assumption is the intent is for this to be the first of a seven book series since only the first of the seven tasks is completed here.  Possibly some of the conflicts established in the first half will be resolved by the end of the series, but with very little hint or promise of that a reader might not bother to find out",Two Half Books,1293580800,8,8,3,0

"I decided to read this book because of the description.  The premise was compelling.This book was very slow in many parts.  I felt the author suggested many previously published stories such as THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL, THE DAVINCI CODE and APOLLO 13.  I was often disturbed by the back and forth of the story going from one group of characters to another.  I also didn't like how some characters were introduced toward the end of the book with no back story.  Also some characters throughout the book were left without closure at the end.What I did like in this book was how good the author was at making me want to find out what would happen next. His suspense and action scenes were very well done. I read this book straight through even though I needed to skim many of the slow parts.  This book read like an unedited first draft and would have been a prime candidate for a rewrite.  This author shows promise but needs to tighten this plot.

I enjoyed the appearance of the original cast of the first book and look forward to their eventual stories when they're all grown up. However, I just didn't like the romance in this story. Maybe because this is only a novella, I just didn't buy their quick courtship. And when they fell into bed (rather uneventfully, I might add) the encounter was hardly satisfying. The plot was pretty unique, but still I just wasn't drawn into it.  I have read novellas that satisfy completely.
