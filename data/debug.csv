I could relate to the characters: the divorcee who's trying to get back in shape and the personal trainer who had a crush on said divorcee when he was a kid. The connection between the two characters is awesome. I love that the hunky hero is attracted to the plus-sized heroine.,Love it!,1397174400,0,0,5,1

"This book was a freebie that I got a while back on my Kindle.It's the story of a serial killer who travels the highway looking for hitchhikers. Once he gets them he enjoys killing and torturing them. After having enjoyed a kill earlier in the day, he sees a girl hitching under an overpass. He decides he's ready for a new kill. When he picks her up, he realizes she is not the defenseless female that he had thought.This short story is not for the squeamish, but is a twisted story of a serial killer. I thought it was a fun read.",Twisted,1383177600,0,0,4,1

"Ok,  it isn't completely free of holes in the plot.  Most books and movies have them if you spend time thinking about it.  I loved this book and hope she writes the sequel(s).  Much of the book takes place in Meagan's head and the conversations she holds with herself.  Very little of the dialogue is with her vampire lover or anyone else for that matter..  It felt comfortable and believable to me since that is where I spend much of my time - in my own head.  I rather enjoyed this style, although more actual conversations wouldn't have hurt the book(that is a note to the author if she reads this).  I want to know what happens when Meagan explores more of her capabilities as a witch.  I also enjoyed the fallible nature of the vampires in this world.  This was a great free read and I will willingly pay for the next book.",Good start to the series,1305331200,3,3,4,1
"I highly suggest getting this ebook! I agree with several other reviewers in that this is a unique take on a vampire story compared to those that are out there now. I don't want to go into any more details about the plot than others have because I am not wanting to spoil it. This story is the first of three. The sequel is Blood Hunt and I am hoping it will be available soon because I am anxious to read more! There were a few parts of the book that were skim worthy, but I believe it was because I was curious about the ending. I admit to being a bit impatient when the story grips me like this one. I was happy to find out about the story being continued. Congrats to the author!",LOVED IT!! :),1294358400,0,0,5,1

"This was an amazing story. I read it months ago before I started blogging or even knew what blogging was. It's haunted me ever since though since I never reviewed it once I did start blogging lol.The story centers around a nineteen year old girl named Selina whose only mission in life to heal with the special gift she was born with. However each healing she offers brings her closer to death, which is noted by the marking on her neck. Each time she heals the marking magically adds to itself until it encircles her neck and she dies.On this healing expedition she has to travel really far to heal the king of a neighboring kingdom. Despite being told not to go because the trek is dangerous, she knows she will die soon and it may be her only chance to have some adventure in her short life.She meets Faldon he's a shape shifter under a curse. He was once the leader of the Feyquin which are magical horses, the exact opposite of the well known Nitemares of many myths and lore. Faldon wants nothing more than to find the demon that cursed him and the human who shares his curse in the reverse fashion.He despises humans but something about Selina draws him to her and while they're friendship is rocky it's also strong.I found not one error in novella, so kudos to the editor!I absolutely loved this story. I without a doubt teared up at the end of it, my heart breaking for Faldon and Selina.I only wish this author had written a sequel so I could see what became of Faldon and the Feyquin, or even a prequel to learn more about Selina's life before this last trek.This is a great story and I think many people will love.I give this book 5 of 5 paws and apologize for the long delay in my review",Amazing Novella,1378598400,1,1,5,1

"In this prequel, we are sprung into a world where the society as we know it has fallen. People must barter for anything and something only belongs to you so long as you can keep someone else from stealing it. We watch as Elysia tries to steal some food using stealth and some hidden ability to not be seen. Darien watches from the crowd horrified that the woman he's been looking for is about to be killed. They help each other escape Baltimore on a boat and learn about their difficult past together. As they work towards going into the wilderness, they finally find out how to trust each other and then they meet their spirit guide who takes them to others who've answered the call to find a new way to live.This story is fast paced with chapters that are only a few pages long. I was worried at first that I wouldn't understand enough about the story with it being like that, but I was pleasantly surprised. This story definitely peaked my interest and took only a few hours to read. It coming as a prequel to the Aspect of Crow Trilogy and is well written.

"I recently read Turning Back the Clock. I was attracted to this book as a history buff who loves historical fiction. I had some concerns since I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I very quickly realized that I didn't have to be. This story pulled me in from page 1 and kept drawing me in until the very last page. I was also able to learn about a few events in the history of major league baseball that I was totally unaware of.

It was different than the other vamp books which are getting so predictable. There are twists that I have never seen explored in other vamp books I have read, but they enhance the story and dont ruin it. Some books go so far out, it ruins the fantasy.

"This was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.It was well written.  The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story.",Great story,1379203200,0,0,4,1

On what should be the happiest night of her life, her life was falling apart.  Catherine was going to have a baby, and now wasn't sure that she would have anyone to fill the father role.  She had planned a vacation for all of them, and now Rhys and Logan wouldn't even be there.  Everything was more important than she was.  She didn't even rank anymore.  So sure it was over, Catherine decided to go on the vacation to Jamaica alone to figure out what her next step was now that she was on her own.Rhys and Logan were panicked when they arrived home to find Catherine gone.  She had been gone for days, and they hadn't even known.  Figuring she went on vacation without them, they headed for Jamaica to get their woman back.  When they arrived, they couldn't believe how distant and withdrawn she was.  Rhys and Logan knew how abominably they had treated her not just recently, but for years.  That sad fact had become abundantly clear, and there was no one to blame except themselves.  Catherine had always been there loving them, and they were no longer sure she would stay with them.  Rhys and Logan had a lot of hurt to make up for, and would stop at nothing to convince Catherine she would always come first.MB has done it again!

"Irish author and poet James Lawless was born in Dublin, read Irish and Spanish at the University College Dublin, followed by honors studies in Communications and Cultural Studies at Dublin City University. He has been both a secondary schools teacher and a guest lecturer as well as volunteering for social concerns organizations. His highly successful career has been molded by not only his gifts as a poet, a writer of short stories, and a novelist (he is widely published) but also by his concerns with humanitarian issues and political histories. He currently has homes in both County Kildare and West Cork.FOR LOVE OF ANNA, Lawless' second novel is a story of love, ideology and corruption. The author wisely introduces his own summary of the novel, guiding the reader to the important themes: ""There are three main strands running through this novel. Firstly, it may be read as a poignant love story - Anna is a ballerina with whom the main protagonist, the university student, Guido van Thool, falls in love. But Anna is also an acronym for Anarchists of the New Age, which brings us to the second dimension of the novel as an ideological story positing ideas in the mind of the philosophy student Guido, in the wake of the collapse of Russian communism and the dilution of oppositional politics, on what alternatives there are to the all-devouring monolith of corporate capitalism. Anna wants to steer him away from this sort of 'dangerous' thinking, but his friend, the anarchist Philippe, keeps goading him. Paralleling the lives of the lovers is that of a corrupt judge, Jeremiah Delahyde (the third strand) who literally crashes into the world of Guido and Anna on a fatal New Years night."" Anna's death at the hands of the drunken Delahyde in an auto `accident' sets into action a line of revenge by Guido - a move that ties the three threads of the novel together tightly. Love, passion, philosophy, the arts, devotion, anti-globalization marches all play major roles here. It is an engrossing novel that marries a passionate love against examples of what power does to people, how a single turn of events can create a chain reaction of incredible proportions and leads even the most nave of people to act in unimaginable ways.Lawless writing is mesmerizing. Once he establishes each of his characters he has seared them on our minds, and all the complexities of the interaction of human love, the exigencies that corruption consumes power, and the even greater issues of morality become increasingly focused until the novel's brilliant end. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, February 14",A searing story from an increasingly impressive Irish writer,1391299200,1,1,5,1

"I still can't believe the low price for this story...do not assume that the low price equates to low quality...far from it!  Though set in a post-apocalyptic world that has seen civilization reduced to simple survival, it is not dismal.  There is much hope, especially expressed by those who must learn to persevere and endure, finding a way to reconnect with humanity again.  The romantic tension is intriguing and exciting between the central characters, but what moves the story forward are the questions that naturally arise:  What would those who survived after a global collapse do?  How do they begin to rebuild?  Can humanity endure?  And yes, even the cheesy, can love overcome all obstacles?  Ultimately, these ideas are what resonate most and make this story a keeper.  Try it.

I love the relationship that Allie and Alex share better in it and I think Scott is her soul mate. I also felt it was like the author was trying to hurry up and end the book.

"J.C. Wilder has presented us with an intense book which grabbed my attention at the first and never let go. This contemporary romance had a sensuality score that shot through the roof. This definitely is not for the timid reader. For the adventurous reader, however, this is the book to read.Wilder's characters were vibrant, likeable people which kept me turning the pages. The myriad of supporting players in this book meshed together to create an above-average saga. The storyline pivoted around the long-time love story between two people who couldn't quite forget the other. Nine years left a time gap, but one Wilder was able to capture in her unique way.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a sizzling romance with lots of twists and turns on the way to its happily-ever-after.

She is partnered with Lieutenant Jared ""Mac"" McNally whose arrogant and cynical attitude just rubs her the wrong way. If only he didn't attract her so much she could concentrate on what needed to be done and actually get the assignment done.Mac immediately rises to the challenge when Kelly protests against using her class for his operation. She sees him as a judgmental person who is out to trap her students before they've had a chance to escape their terrible home lives. Their tempers rise as they both refuse to back down, but so does their passion. When they disagree on a certain student, Kelly lets her pride influence a decision that could put her in grave danger.Covert Lessons by Mari Carr was an interesting read. The storyline was fast-paced and easy to relate to. Mac and Kelly's tempers soon give way to a push and pull passion they try to put off in order to keep up professional ethics. When they spend time together, learning the backgrounds on Kelly's students, a deep friendship and bond is formed. The sexual chemistry between the two characters eventually explodes and it is scorching! I loved the flow of the story and the ending was thrilling. I could not put it down.

"Declan Mayo is the newest rent boy at The Chicken Ranch.  Although nervous and inexperienced, Declan is desperate for money. Killian Hamilton is quiet and keeps to himself. Loneliness sends him to The Chicken Ranch looking for temporary company. Declan and Killian's time together at The Ranch is explosive. A few months later, a chance meeting reunites Killian and Declan and they decide to take the next step. Will Declan's career get in the way of what could be the best thing that ever happened to him?I really like the dynamics between Declan and Killian in Hunger. They are genuinely sweet guys and they take their relationship slow. Because of their unconventional meeting, it seems impossible that they could have a relationship, but it works. It was hard for me to accept that Declan is a prostitute, and that he continues to `work' while he and Killian are dating, but Killian is surprisingly okay with it. Killian's nervous stuttering is endearing and Declan's painful past is sad, Overall, Hunger is a good story starring two charming men.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Chicken Ranch,1269561600,1,1,5,1

"Ok,  it isn't completely free of holes in the plot.  Most books and movies have them if you spend time thinking about it.  I loved this book and hope she writes the sequel(s).  Much of the book takes place in Meagan's head and the conversations she holds with herself.  Very little of the dialogue is with her vampire lover or anyone else for that matter..  It felt comfortable and believable to me since that is where I spend much of my time - in my own head.  I rather enjoyed this style, although more actual conversations wouldn't have hurt the book(that is a note to the author if she reads this).  I want to know what happens when Meagan explores more of her capabilities as a witch.  I also enjoyed the fallible nature of the vampires in this world.

"This was an amazing story. I read it months ago before I started blogging or even knew what blogging was. It's haunted me ever since though since I never reviewed it once I did start blogging lol.The story centers around a nineteen year old girl named Selina whose only mission in life to heal with the special gift she was born with. However each healing she offers brings her closer to death, which is noted by the marking on her neck. Each time she heals the marking magically adds to itself until it encircles her neck and she dies.On this healing expedition she has to travel really far to heal the king of a neighboring kingdom. Despite being told not to go because the trek is dangerous, she knows she will die soon and it may be her only chance to have some adventure in her short life.She meets Faldon he's a shape shifter under a curse. He was once the leader of the Feyquin which are magical horses, the exact opposite of the well known Nitemares of many myths and lore. Faldon wants nothing more than to find the demon that cursed him and the human who shares his curse in the reverse fashion.He despises humans but something about Selina draws him to her and while they're friendship is rocky it's also strong.I found not one error in novella, so kudos to the editor!I absolutely loved this story. I without a doubt teared up at the end of it, my heart breaking for Faldon and Selina.I only wish this author had written a sequel so I could see what became of Faldon and the Feyquin, or even a prequel to learn more about Selina's life before this last trek.This is a great story and I think many people will love.I give this book 5 of 5 paws and apologize for the long delay in my review",Amazing Novella,1378598400,1,1,5,1

"I recently read Turning Back the Clock. I was attracted to this book as a history buff who loves historical fiction. I had some concerns since I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I very quickly realized that I didn't have to be. This story pulled me in from page 1 and kept drawing me in until the very last page. I was also able to learn about a few events in the history of major league baseball that I was totally unaware of.  From a different angle, who hasn't dreamed of going back in time to meet your favorite sports or historical figure? This is a great mix of science fiction, history, and of course America's favorite past-time. Well done, John Fitch V!

It was different than the other vamp books which are getting so predictable. There are twists that I have never seen explored in other vamp books I have read, but they enhance the story and dont ruin it. Some books go so far out, it ruins the fantasy. This one makes the twists work without spoiling the fantasy. I am so waiting for the next installment. Definitely give it a try!!",A new twist,1297987200,0,0,5,1

"This was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.It was well written.  The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story.",Great story,1379203200,0,0,4,1

On what should be the happiest night of her life, her life was falling apart.  Catherine was going to have a baby, and now wasn't sure that she would have anyone to fill the father role.  She had planned a vacation for all of them, and now Rhys and Logan wouldn't even be there.  Everything was more important than she was.  She didn't even rank anymore.  So sure it was over, Catherine decided to go on the vacation to Jamaica alone to figure out what her next step was now that she was on her own.Rhys and Logan were panicked when they arrived home to find Catherine gone.  She had been gone for days, and they hadn't even known.  Figuring she went on vacation without them, they headed for Jamaica to get their woman back.  When they arrived, they couldn't believe how distant and withdrawn she was.  Rhys and Logan knew how abominably they had treated her not just recently, but for years.  That sad fact had become abundantly clear, and there was no one to blame except themselves.  Catherine had always been there loving them, and they were no longer sure she would stay with them.  Rhys and Logan had a lot of hurt to make up for, and would stop at nothing to convince Catherine she would always come first.MB has done it again!

"Irish author and poet James Lawless was born in Dublin, read Irish and Spanish at the University College Dublin, followed by honors studies in Communications and Cultural Studies at Dublin City University. He has been both a secondary schools teacher and a guest lecturer as well as volunteering for social concerns organizations. His highly successful career has been molded by not only his gifts as a poet, a writer of short stories, and a novelist (he is widely published) but also by his concerns with humanitarian issues and political histories. He currently has homes in both County Kildare and West Cork.FOR LOVE OF ANNA, Lawless' second novel is a story of love, ideology and corruption. The author wisely introduces his own summary of the novel, guiding the reader to the important themes: ""There are three main strands running through this novel. Firstly, it may be read as a poignant love story - Anna is a ballerina with whom the main protagonist, the university student, Guido van Thool, falls in love. But Anna is also an acronym for Anarchists of the New Age, which brings us to the second dimension of the novel as an ideological story positing ideas in the mind of the philosophy student Guido, in the wake of the collapse of Russian communism and the dilution of oppositional politics, on what alternatives there are to the all-devouring monolith of corporate capitalism. Anna wants to steer him away from this sort of 'dangerous' thinking, but his friend, the anarchist Philippe, keeps goading him. Paralleling the lives of the lovers is that of a corrupt judge, Jeremiah Delahyde (the third strand) who literally crashes into the world of Guido and Anna on a fatal New Years night."" Anna's death at the hands of the drunken Delahyde in an auto `accident' sets into action a line of revenge by Guido - a move that ties the three threads of the novel together tightly. Love, passion, philosophy, the arts, devotion, anti-globalization marches all play major roles here. It is an engrossing novel that marries a passionate love against examples of what power does to people, how a single turn of events can create a chain reaction of incredible proportions and leads even the most nave of people to act in unimaginable ways.Lawless writing is mesmerizing. Once he establishes each of his characters he has seared them on our minds, and all the complexities of the interaction of human love, the exigencies that corruption consumes power, and the even greater issues of morality become increasingly focused until the novel's brilliant end. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, February 14",A searing story from an increasingly impressive Irish writer,1391299200,1,1,5,1

"I still can't believe the low price for this story...do not assume that the low price equates to low quality...far from it!  Though set in a post-apocalyptic world that has seen civilization reduced to simple survival, it is not dismal.  There is much hope, especially expressed by those who must learn to persevere and endure, finding a way to reconnect with humanity again.  The romantic tension is intriguing and exciting between the central characters, but what moves the story forward are the questions that naturally arise:  What would those who survived after a global collapse do?  How do they begin to rebuild?  Can humanity endure?  And yes, even the cheesy, can love overcome all obstacles?  Ultimately, these ideas are what resonate most and make this story a keeper.  Try it.

"J.C. Wilder has presented us with an intense book which grabbed my attention at the first and never let go. This contemporary romance had a sensuality score that shot through the roof. This definitely is not for the timid reader. For the adventurous reader, however, this is the book to read.Wilder's characters were vibrant, likeable people which kept me turning the pages. The myriad of supporting players in this book meshed together to create an above-average saga. The storyline pivoted around the long-time love story between two people who couldn't quite forget the other. Nine years left a time gap, but one Wilder was able to capture in her unique way.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a sizzling romance with lots of twists and turns on the way to its happily-ever-after.

Much of the book takes place in Meagan's head and the conversations she holds with herself.  Very little of the dialogue is with her vampire lover or anyone else for that matter..  It felt comfortable and believable to me since that is where I spend much of my time - in my own head.  I rather enjoyed this style, although more actual conversations wouldn't have hurt the book(that is a note to the author if she reads this).

"This was an amazing story. I read it months ago before I started blogging or even knew what blogging was. It's haunted me ever since though since I never reviewed it once I did start blogging lol.The story centers around a nineteen year old girl named Selina whose only mission in life to heal with the special gift she was born with. However each healing she offers brings her closer to death, which is noted by the marking on her neck. Each time she heals the marking magically adds to itself until it encircles her neck and she dies.On this healing expedition she has to travel really far to heal the king of a neighboring kingdom. Despite being told not to go because the trek is dangerous, she knows she will die soon and it may be her only chance to have some adventure in her short life.She meets Faldon he's a shape shifter under a curse. He was once the leader of the Feyquin which are magical horses, the exact opposite of the well known Nitemares of many myths and lore. Faldon wants nothing more than to find the demon that cursed him and the human who shares his curse in the reverse fashion.He despises humans but something about Selina draws him to her and while they're friendship is rocky it's also strong.I found not one error in novella, so kudos to the editor!I absolutely loved this story. I without a doubt teared up at the end of it, my heart breaking for Faldon and Selina.I only wish this author had written a sequel so I could see what became of Faldon and the Feyquin, or even a prequel to learn more about Selina's life before this last trek.This is a great story and I think many people will love.I give this book 5 of 5 paws and apologize for the long delay in my review",Amazing Novella,1378598400,1,1,5,1

"In this prequel, we are sprung into a world where the society as we know it has fallen. People must barter for anything and something only belongs to you so long as you can keep someone else from stealing it. We watch as Elysia tries to steal some food using stealth and some hidden ability to not be seen. Darien watches from the crowd horrified that the woman he's been looking for is about to be killed. They help each other escape Baltimore on a boat and learn about their difficult past together. As they work towards going into the wilderness, they finally find out how to trust each other and then they meet their spirit guide who takes them to others who've answered the call to find a new way to live.This story is fast paced with chapters that are only a few pages long. I was worried at first that I wouldn't understand enough about the story with it being like that, but I was pleasantly surprised. This story definitely peaked my interest and took only a few hours to read. It coming as a prequel to the Aspect of Crow Trilogy and is well written.

"I recently read Turning Back the Clock. I was attracted to this book as a history buff who loves historical fiction. I had some concerns since I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I very quickly realized that I didn't have to be. This story pulled me in from page 1 and kept drawing me in until the very last page. I was also able to learn about a few events in the history of major league baseball that I was totally unaware of.

"This was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.It was well written.  The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story.",Great story,1379203200,0,0,4,1

On what should be the happiest night of her life, her life was falling apart.  Catherine was going to have a baby, and now wasn't sure that she would have anyone to fill the father role.  She had planned a vacation for all of them, and now Rhys and Logan wouldn't even be there.  Everything was more important than she was.  She didn't even rank anymore.  So sure it was over, Catherine decided to go on the vacation to Jamaica alone to figure out what her next step was now that she was on her own.Rhys and Logan were panicked when they arrived home to find Catherine gone.  She had been gone for days, and they hadn't even known.  Figuring she went on vacation without them, they headed for Jamaica to get their woman back.  When they arrived, they couldn't believe how distant and withdrawn she was.  Rhys and Logan knew how abominably they had treated her not just recently, but for years.  That sad fact had become abundantly clear, and there was no one to blame except themselves.  Catherine had always been there loving them, and they were no longer sure she would stay with them.  Rhys and Logan had a lot of hurt to make up for, and would stop at nothing to convince Catherine she would always come first.MB has done it again!

"Irish author and poet James Lawless was born in Dublin, read Irish and Spanish at the University College Dublin, followed by honors studies in Communications and Cultural Studies at Dublin City University. He has been both a secondary schools teacher and a guest lecturer as well as volunteering for social concerns organizations. His highly successful career has been molded by not only his gifts as a poet, a writer of short stories, and a novelist (he is widely published) but also by his concerns with humanitarian issues and political histories. He currently has homes in both County Kildare and West Cork.FOR LOVE OF ANNA, Lawless' second novel is a story of love, ideology and corruption. The author wisely introduces his own summary of the novel, guiding the reader to the important themes: ""There are three main strands running through this novel. Firstly, it may be read as a poignant love story - Anna is a ballerina with whom the main protagonist, the university student, Guido van Thool, falls in love. But Anna is also an acronym for Anarchists of the New Age, which brings us to the second dimension of the novel as an ideological story positing ideas in the mind of the philosophy student Guido, in the wake of the collapse of Russian communism and the dilution of oppositional politics, on what alternatives there are to the all-devouring monolith of corporate capitalism. Anna wants to steer him away from this sort of 'dangerous' thinking, but his friend, the anarchist Philippe, keeps goading him. Paralleling the lives of the lovers is that of a corrupt judge, Jeremiah Delahyde (the third strand) who literally crashes into the world of Guido and Anna on a fatal New Years night."" Anna's death at the hands of the drunken Delahyde in an auto `accident' sets into action a line of revenge by Guido - a move that ties the three threads of the novel together tightly. Love, passion, philosophy, the arts, devotion, anti-globalization marches all play major roles here. It is an engrossing novel that marries a passionate love against examples of what power does to people, how a single turn of events can create a chain reaction of incredible proportions and leads even the most nave of people to act in unimaginable ways.Lawless writing is mesmerizing. Once he establishes each of his characters he has seared them on our minds, and all the complexities of the interaction of human love, the exigencies that corruption consumes power, and the even greater issues of morality become increasingly focused until the novel's brilliant end. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, February 14",A searing story from an increasingly impressive Irish writer,1391299200,1,1,5,1

The romantic tension is intriguing and exciting between the central characters, but what moves the story forward are the questions that naturally arise:  What would those who survived after a global collapse do?  How do they begin to rebuild?  Can humanity endure?  And yes, even the cheesy, can love overcome all obstacles?  Ultimately, these ideas are what resonate most and make this story a keeper.  Try it.  You won't regret it.",What a deal for so much more...,1326153600,0,0,5,1

"I read What a Catch before this one and loved it, so I figured I'd give Pitcher Perfect a try because I loved Allie and Alex's friendship in What a Catch. They totally understand each other and I love reading the dialogue between the two of them.I loved this book, but I have to say I enjoyed What a Catch more. I love the relationship that Allie and Alex share better in it and I think Scott is her soul mate. I also felt it was like the author was trying to hurry up and end the book. I found the end sort of happened pretty sudden. I would have enjoyed a little more to the ending, it feels like I didn't get the closure that I did in What a Catch.",Very enjoyable but felt kinda cheated,1319932800,0,0,5,1

"J.C. Wilder has presented us with an intense book which grabbed my attention at the first and never let go. This contemporary romance had a sensuality score that shot through the roof. This definitely is not for the timid reader. For the adventurous reader, however, this is the book to read.Wilder's characters were vibrant, likeable people which kept me turning the pages. The myriad of supporting players in this book meshed together to create an above-average saga. The storyline pivoted around the long-time love story between two people who couldn't quite forget the other. Nine years left a time gap, but one Wilder was able to capture in her unique way.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a sizzling romance with lots of twists and turns on the way to its happily-ever-after. You will not be disappointed. _ Brenda Talley",5 Hearts from TRS!,1280448000,1,1,5,1

The storyline was fast-paced and easy to relate to. Mac and Kelly's tempers soon give way to a push and pull passion they try to put off in order to keep up professional ethics. When they spend time together, learning the backgrounds on Kelly's students, a deep friendship and bond is formed. The sexual chemistry between the two characters eventually explodes and it is scorching! I loved the flow of the story and the ending was thrilling. I could not put it down.

"I am partial to post-apostoliptic (spelling?)books, movies whatever and in this respect this book was no disapointment.  As a relative unknown author, I admire his courage and stick-to-i-tiveness in this first book of the series.  I nearly quit reading about a third of the way through, but desided to give this guy the benefit of the doubt and finished.  By golly he's doing really well.  He could use a second set of eyes to help him edit typos and such, but aside from that I was glad I didn't give up on the author.  I have read the whole series and enjoyed it.  Fare thee well Mr. Sides; fare thee well.  rsmquilts  R. Sharon McGovern",Looking Forward,1283385600,4,4,4,1

"Declan Mayo is the newest rent boy at The Chicken Ranch.  Although nervous and inexperienced, Declan is desperate for money. Killian Hamilton is quiet and keeps to himself. Loneliness sends him to The Chicken Ranch looking for temporary company. Declan and Killian's time together at The Ranch is explosive. A few months later, a chance meeting reunites Killian and Declan and they decide to take the next step. Will Declan's career get in the way of what could be the best thing that ever happened to him?I really like the dynamics between Declan and Killian in Hunger. They are genuinely sweet guys and they take their relationship slow. Because of their unconventional meeting, it seems impossible that they could have a relationship, but it works. It was hard for me to accept that Declan is a prostitute, and that he continues to `work' while he and Killian are dating, but Killian is surprisingly okay with it. Killian's nervous stuttering is endearing and Declan's painful past is sad, Overall, Hunger is a good story starring two charming men.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Chicken Ranch,1269561600,1,1,5,1
Top notch writing from Castillo Price as usual. There is a creepy feeling throughout the book when Vic comes out of his many years of drug haze and starts to notice things. His paranoia is based in real events but it can also cause very real problems in his personal life.,"Ooooh, secrets....",1364169600,0,0,5,1
