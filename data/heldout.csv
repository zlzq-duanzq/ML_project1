"Safe Harbor by Tymber DaltonVery Good story.  I really enjoyed this book and the relationship between Clarisse, Mac and Sully. I especially loved `The Dom Dog' and his new chew toy.

"Smith is a fabulous writer, but in CHOKE ON YOUR LIES, he tries to do too many things at the same time. It begins with the protagonist, college professor Mick Thooft, seeking help from his old friend, the morbidly obese Octavia VanderPlatts, when his wife tries to cheat him out of his house (in a fashionable part of Minneapolis) in a divorce settlement. Pretty soon things get really complicated, but Octavia has a plan to solve Mick's problems while punishing his wife at the same time. Unfortunately, the portion of the novel doesn't deliver the great climax we were expecting because Smith is only half-finished at that point. Pretty soon there is a murder and other legal problems and once again Mick needs Octavia's help. Whereas Smith's superb novels YELLOW MEDICINE and HOTDOGGIN' are non-stop, well-done action, CHOKE ON YOUR LIES is a bit of a meandering mess. It definitely has its moments, and the characterization is good--with the notable exception of Mick, who is a bit of a wuss. Along the way, Smith shoehorns in too much other stuff, such as opinions about Minneapolis and Vietnamese food, and pretty much anything else that appeared to be on his mind, including name-dropping a few bands and songs.Still, there is enough going on here that I don't feel like I wasted my time. I look forward to reading Smith's other books that I have in my collection. But this one definitely could have use some strong editorial guidance.",2 Books in One!

Some of the central ""stretches of reality"", such as the implant itself, were handled in a somewhat credible manner, much as is done in good science fiction.

"Josh Lanyon's novella ""The Dickens with Love"" is a story of love, redemption and holiday spirit that will both entertain and charm its readers. Basically, this is a Christmas story about a Christmas story; it is clever, well-written, and frequently humorous, and it captures the many facets of the holiday season. Within the pages of this story, we find Christmas cheer, seasonal depression, music both annoying and inspiring, fellowship and family, and that magical feeling of anticipation that comes no other time of the year.Lovers of Charles Dickens - actually book lovers, period - will find this to be a fascinating tale. What bibliophile doesn't dream of finding an undiscovered manuscript written by a master? Although the tale in question, ""The Christmas Cake"", doesn't exist, Mr. Lanyon has built up a solid story around it and has made its existence seem entirely plausible. He includes wonderful small excerpts from this fictional work, and although I cannot profess to be an expert on that author, these passages simply screamed ""Dickens"" at me. Of course, now I want to read The Christmas Cake, and it doesn't exist, darn it.Along with a very witty and well-paced narrative and an involving plot, Mr. Lanyon gives us a couple of almost irresistible main characters. First there is James Winter, the narrator of the story. There is no way that you cannot love this fellow, who is something of a loner and has a self-deprecating wit and a hint of sadness that will reel you right in to him. Then we have Sedgwick Crisparkle, great-great-great-grandson of Canon Crisparkle, a character in Charles Dickens' ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood."" He wears a stern demeanor like a mask, but under his many protective layers is a man who is has a lot of love to offer others.Mr. Lanyon has a way of making the reader feel the emotions of his characters. We laugh when they laugh, and we hurt when they do; we experience their ups and downs. During one memorable scene, Sedgwick calls James a whore in a fit of anger, and the effect is like a slap in the face. The overall effect that this had on me was that I became very invested in a happy ending for these characters.While ""The Dickens with Love"" is not a whodunit, Mr. Lanyon still incorporates an element of mystery to it as James investigates the Dickens manuscript and tries to untangle its background and origins. I found this process of discovery to be a very interesting and well executed addition to the story.  Overall, I truly enjoyed ""The Dickens with Love."" This story is smart, fun, and just plain entertaining, and I found reading to be an excellent way to usher in the holiday season.",an excellent way to usher in the holiday season,1260748800,19,19

A different kind of book. Not quite what I expected. The book consists of several short stories that allow us a brief view into the narrator's (authors?) life as he grows both physically and emotionally. Each story seems to carry a hint of regret or apology for his actions. We all have things we regret from our youth. This seems to be somewhat of a purging or cleansing for the author.

"This book is about a spiritual battle between good and the evil trying to take over, prophesies to be fulfilled and learning to have true faith.  There are angels, demons, warrior priests, fallen angels and a young boy born with special powers to save the world.  Ethan's confusion as he learns about himself and his unique abilities make you care for him. His alternating youthful over-confidence and insecurity as he is thrown into a world far beyond anything he is prepared for forces him to look beyond himself for help. As he grows spiritually, he learns that his strengths come from faith in a higher power.From the moment you pick up the book, the author draws you right in with good character development, a great storyline, lots of sub-plots.  Still, it flows quickly and smoothly, without getting bogged down in the details.  There was no need for overly-graphic scenes, making the book appropriate for all readers!  The ending was perfect to leave you wanting to read more, leading you into the next book in the trilogy!  The worst thing I can say about the book was that it wasn't at LEAST 300 pages longer!Great work, as are all of the books I have read by Mr. Somers!",Extremely well-written!,1256083200,29,29
"I didn't expect to write a review of this book.  I read a lot of books, way too many to do reviews for all of them, so I generally only write reviews if they were exceptionally good or really bad.  I don't want to take the time to review an average book.  And this one should have been average.  It reminded me of an 80's Harlequin, with Yanis, rich and powerful, dominating Lee throughout most of the book.  I was ok with that because I was in the mood for a ""mean"" hero and I thought the storyline flowed pretty well.  I noticed in reviews of her other books that people complained about grammatical errors.  There were plenty of those, but if the story is good enough I don't mind overlooking them.What I couldn't overlook was the overuse of the word ""had"".  By the middle of the book it was to the point that I couldn't even concentrate on the story because ""had"" kept jumping out at me.  Sometimes several in one sentence.  Out of curiosity I counted them once and there were 16 just on one page.  So I basically just skimmed the last half of the book because it was too painful plowing through the ""hads"".  But the story itself was good enough that I wanted to see how it ended.If not for all of the ""hads"" throughout the book I would have given it 3 stars.  It's a nice average story.  I got Kidnapped the Wrong Sister by this author because it was free and I'm sure I'll read it, but I noticed one of the reviews for that book also mentioned that had was overused, so it's obviously a trend.  That's too bad because her books have a lot of potential.  I don't think I will pay for any more of her books though.","Had, had, had, had enough",1354838400,1,1

Isaac knew his friend was afraid of heights and that he would never get that close to the edge of the overlook.

"Can't say I've subscribed yet, but I have picked up an occasional issue of Reader's Digest on the Kindle.  It's a good mix of light feature pieces (an entertaining profile of actor Pierce Brosnan was a good read) and long, detailed investigative articles (good one on the airline industry in the same issue).  You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.  If there's one criticism I have of Kindle blogs and magazines, it's visual sameness.  The New York Times looks like Newsweek which looks like The Philadelphia Inquirer, etc.  But Reader's Digest on the Kindle looks like, well... Reader's Digest.  You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.  I guess it's a small point (as content is really the most important thing), but it's nice seeing a Kindle magazine that looks truly different from other Kindle magazines.  With luck this will be the beginning of a trend.But, yeah, give an issue a shot.  Even if you usually read weightier fare on your Kindle, you may just find the content and visual flair of Reader's Digest on the Kindle to be an occasional refreshing change.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.","Engaging material, with graphics that stand out",1217980800,68,68

"Good fiction.  It saddens me that so many bright knowledgable people have invested so heavily in theories that seem to be lackingNon-theoretical evidence .  So much has been invested, both financially and intellectually, that it is impossible for many to step back and re-evaluate the climate change issue.  Be it cooling where warming was predicted, or a full host of other inconsistent data, folks hold on to the sacred mantra of global warming.  Mother earth is ,more complex  than those with a political agenda.Too much prestige, too much integrity has been sacrificed.  Tot say nothing of the financial and political will expended.Is some type of climate change occurring? Most likely.  Can we predict the outcome or change the course?  Highly unlikely .While some preach to the masses about the sacrafice they must make.  They go home to their decidedly unenviromental mansions, in their gulf stream-III's, and snicker about stories they tell the idealistic college students and intelligencia, and get paid for it!

"I really liked the idea of this story, but I was unable to read it to find out if there was anything to it.  It started out very choppy, completely confusing, and just plain not readable. I removed it from my Kindle a little bit into the second chapter.The story starts with a lady burning a barn with animals in it. There are names of people that you have no idea who they are, and there is a thing that I think was supposed to be a ghost, but you don't get clarification on that either. The second chapter starts with more people that you don't know, and goes into attempting to kill an unborn child. At that point I quit. I did not know who or what was happening, and quite honestly I did not care to find out.Sorry to be harsh, but this was not something that I could even pretend to like.

"4.5 CocktailsThis book is number five in the Western Wind series. However, this book would be fine as a standalone book. I actually read this book after book six and I had no trouble understanding anything. The books are not primarily sequenced chronologically, and the author tells the story of each reaper up to a certain point in time.This installment of the Reaper series is about reaper Bevyn Coure. Bevyn is a handsome guy that becomes a reaper in one of the most gruesome ways I've read. He's sensitive, strong, loyal, and tormented by his past. Bevyn stumbles into town and finds himself drawn to Lea Walsh. I really didn't like Lea. She was just didn't seem to fit Bevyn's personality. She despised the very thing that made him the man she came to love. She was illogical, high strung, and whenever Bevyn wasn't jumping through her hoops she nagged constantly. I loved the other background characters surrounding Bevyn and Lea's story.The storyline of the reapers and their dramatic storylines filled with elements of comedy, adventure, and suspense continue to draw me in and make me crave my next dose. This story as were the others moved quickly and Boyett-Compo is an expert at melding the past with the future seamlessly. I didn't get lost along the way, and the author easily drew parallels between Bevyn's past experiences and his present life experiences. I was totally vested in the characters, and I was so afraid that Bevyn was going to be killed. I only wish that Lea would have been written out of the storyline. The steam level was off the charts. Bevyn certainly was a reaper that knew his way around a woman's body.Charlotte Boyett-Compo has done it again.

"When Catch Me If You Can came up for review on another site that I review books for, I eagerly snatched it up. Although I've never read anything by Ms. Gregg before, I'd heard her name mentioned by several people whose opinions I value and they've all lauded her work. So, I read it and . . . it was a nice read.The dialogue was witty and fun. And I felt sorry for Caesar who seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. I appreciated the way he never bitched and moaned about all these problems that were heaped up on him. He didn't sit down and have a pity party like so many characters often do. He just jumped in and tried to find solutions, in his unique and odd way which added to the charm of Catch Me If You Can.The mystery inside Catch Me If You Can seemed to be more of a comedy of errors instead of anything serious or focused. To give a good comparison, I felt like I was watching Ethel and Lucy from I Love Lucy. I don't know if this is because of what I do in my day-to-day job, but I was seriously annoyed that no one called the police or anything. Their reasoning behind not doing so was flimsy and didn't ring true. I freely admit that this may be a bias on my part since I interact with the police on a daily basis.The relationship between Caesar and Dan was nice. The respect they had for each other had the makings to develop into something more powerful as time goes on, but I would've liked to see a little more depth between the two of them. There were so many secondary characters that Caesar and Dan's developing relationship didn't appear to be the focal point of Catch Me If You Can. I missed that, I wanted to see Dan and Caesar develop and struggle through their trust issues to see if they'd make a go at it. This was barely glanced at.Overall Catch Me If You Can is a fun and breezy read. You'll laugh out loud several times at some of the dialogue. While I love lite books, I felt that the comedy aspect overwhelmed the development of Caesar and Dan's relationship, which in my humble opinion should've been the focal point.COURTESY of CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES",Good Story Wish it Focused More on the Romance,1269388800,0,0

"Another one that I picked up as a Kindle freebie.James is one of the chief doctors in the emergency room at a London hospital, with a strict rule of never mixing his personal life with his work one. Until late one night a massive car accident brings an unexpected but familiar patient, his ex-wife Lorna, into the E.R. Lorna, also a doctor, but a small town GP looking for a change, was in London applying for a hospital position. With no close friends or family in the city, and in no shape to make a long journey back to Scotland James takes Lorna into his home and personally takes over her care.Soon James and Lorna find themselves questioning the painful reasons that their brief marriage ended ten years prior. Will bringing up the old tragedy and hurt that strained their relationship to it's breaking point allow them to finally have closure, or will it bring them even closer?I really enjoyed this book. It was very sweet and thoughtful. I really liked all of the characters and felt that the author presented them in a way in which the read could commiserate with both parties.This book is very emotional, but for Lorna, the heroine, it was mostly internal meaning she refused to talk to the hero about issues that were essentially keeping them apart. This is really the only problem I had with the story, because it prolonged the outcome of the book, making it longer than necessary.",Really liked this one.,1389657600,0,0

"the concept is a great idea for an apocalyptic novel - though it might take another writer to really hit a home run with the idea.Told as if in a series of interviews with different people, whether male or female, whatever the culture, Powell's characters all sound alike. Yet the situations the world faces by 2084 are compelling and well thought out. Continuing a baseball analogy, Powell hits a double with this effort, at best. Not a great work of fiction, but it should make the reader think and, for that reason, succeeds well enough.In Powell's vision of Earth in 2084, the world hasn't done one thing to halt global warming. There isn't one mention of a carbon mitigation strategy, no carbon sequestration, no alternative energy, nothing. Can that be accurate with the way the solar energy industry is taking off? Or wind farms, geothermal or the myriad other alternative energies? 2084 is long enough away for mankind to be convinced about the validity of global warming either one way or another. I don't think people would just roll over and accept a heating planet with the kind of consequences spelled out here.Nevertheless, the aim here isn't story telling so much as it is to scare you about the implications of global warming. This is agenda-driven fiction. On that front it succeeds handily. With every tornado, overly hot day or any other weather event, I  guarantee you're going to be thinking of the shrinking tropical glaciers, the diminishing Rocky Mountain snow pack or drought. All of the doomsday scenarios are collected right here.",Whether you believe climate scientists or not...,1306800000,15,15

"Review by EmmaRae: I really didn't like Julia at first. She was whiny and the author kinda kept dwelling on her insecurity without supporting it by fleshing out the character.

"This is Vivian Arend's second visit to Granite Lake and the wolves that live there. Having read the first book, I was intrigued to see where she would take me with this visit. This is first and foremost a love story more than anything. That the main characters just happen to be wolves at times takes nothing away from that. I love Granite Lake,the richly detailed scenic areas that these stories are set in. Ms. Arend's character development is nothing short of superb. I love the gentle strength and determination that Missy displays when she is faced with trouble. She doesn't run away, she just works toward her goals. I giggled a bit when Tad was called to the Granite Lake pack and told there was someone willing to Firstmate with him and he was sure it was an older, blue haired woman he had seen at gatherings. The pleasant surprise he felt when he learned Missy was the one offering was genuinely portrayed, as was his relief. And the misunderstanding that arose when Tad tried to be noble and not force a bond on Missy, thinking she had a chance to meet her true mate was humorous, although quite painful for Tad in the end. When the confrontation with the nasty alpha comes, it is an interesting situation. Do Tad and Missy have their happily ever after? Yes, but it is hard won in the end.

"I am a news junkie and am much more informed about the Middle East than your average reader.  I have also traveled to the area a number of times although I have never been to Beirut.  In spite of this, I found the book to be pretty hard to read and follow.  First the author spends considerable amounts of time talking about businesses, streets, green lines etc. etc. but includes no maps to orient the reader.  I would have preferred some maps instead of all the verbal gymnastics.  Second, the author talks about all of the political groups, where they dominate, etc. etc.  I have some knowledge of these groups and their allegiances, but it really is too much to expect the reader to keep up with all their names, who they represent, and what they are trying to accomplish, especially from thirty years ago.  Also I find it kind of boring that the author is telling a story about spying etc. when the technology was fax machines, onionskin paper, and physical message drops, who is really interested in how these things were done years ago.I also found it really hard to keep track of the characters and who they were, I did not find it interesting to try to remember who was doing what.  This was a book were the Kindle X-ray would have helped but it was not included in this book.  Also the characters were very one dimensional, so the reader never really get's a chance to understand who they are.In my mind the two biggest events in Lebanon were the bombing of the marine barracks and the U.S, embassy and so I thought all the way through the book that the author was leading up to these really important events.  Unfortunately the story is not about the build-up to these events because they never happen in the book.  How is it possible they are not included?  The one thing I did get from the book is that the life of a spy in Beirut during the eighties was pretty boring, highly risky, and very shallow.  I understand from the author's background that he has an in-depth experience in the area.  He needs to use it to tell a better story, not presume that his audience has the same knowledge of the area that he does, and spend more time developing the characters instead of describing what kind of car they are driving.",The Author Presumes too Much of the Reader,1400803200,0,0

"This novel was so emotionally moving my heart literally ached. I loved medieval stories that are well told. And this one has a fantasy twist that makes it that much more fun. Reading about knights and castles are always enjoyable novels for me. Bottom line...Woman of Honor is a well-told, emotionally gripping story. I was literally swept away into the battle scenes, the romance, the fierce loyalty and honor even if it went against matters of the heart. I nearly cried several times while reading this story and was so engrossed a bomb could have gone off outside and I would've kept reading. I am eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. And anyone who has a computer can read this book. While it may not be a print book yet and can only be read in e-book format, it's well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. My heart is still pounding. And don't let that sweet rating fool you. There was some serious passion in this novel, but if you were to compare it to most romances I guess it was sweet since the characters honored each other's purity. But it still sizzled. And talk about an ending that leaves you begging for more. Sheesh! But it was more than satisfying. I'm just glad that April is only a few months away.",Loved this medieval fantasy!,1264550400,3,3

But when all the money in the world will not help get her out of the wheelchair that she is in he feels like he has let Emily down.

So when he finds that the best physical therapist is available, he goes after her. Adam knows that Jaden has been raising money to fund the building of a wing to be a children's rehabilitation center, but the man who was donating one million dollars has rescinded, and the project is now, on hold. Adam offers that one million dollars to Jaden, but there is a catch; Emily has to walk within a certain amount of time or she loses the money.Jaden Monroe is the best physical therapists in the area hospital, but after publicly insulting her ex-boyfriend and causing the hospital to lose his huge donation she finds herself unemployed. When she is approached with the fantastic offer from Adam Steele she takes him up on it. She can definitely help get Emily out of her wheelchair. When she meets Emily and finds out that she has emotional issues as well, she sets out to help her accept this major change in her life. After the failed relationship with one millionaire she has no desire to start a new one, but Adam finds a way to kiss her every chance he gets.

She'd once put off her own desires and put a man's needs ahead of her own but she learned her lesson and isn't about to ever let another man dictate the course of her life.  However, she fully admits that she enjoys having a man in her bed and it's been too long since she's indulged in some down and dirty sexcapades.School's out for winter break and Caitlin's determined to have a good time before returning to her normal life of responsibility and control.  The last thing she expects is to run into a blast from the past called Eamon Blake, an Irishman with whom she'd shared a hot summer fling while staying in Ireland working at his family's pub.  They'd been great friends with benefits back then and Caitlin has no qualms about reawakening that side of their relationship.Eamon made the move from Ireland to establish a photography business in Las Angeles after the death of his father.  He's in Seattle where he has a few shoots to do for clients but running into Caitlin is a huge unexpected bonus.  He'd had a great time with Caitlin in Ireland and he's more than interested in reestablishing the sexual side of their relationship.  What he doesn't expect is the sudden desire for their relationship to be more than casual despite the fact that he isn't ready to settle down.Eamon's only going to be in Seattle for a week so they agree to enjoy the time they're together and part as friends.  Only neither of them is able to let go and via phone calls and occasional visits they continue their affair long distance.  At some point the long distance affair isn't going to cut it any longer.  Will their relationship survive an ultimatum or will they both find themselves alone and heartbroken over what may have been?Lauren Dane books have become a staple in my reading library.  Her stories are character driven, emotional, and always a lot of fun to immerse yourself in for a few hours.

"This was a great short read. Another Kindle freebee and it was worth more that and paid for it. A children's story not really meant for children had me laughing to my self thought the whole thing. The author even prefaces this story by warning parents that they should not read this to young children and it might give them nightmares. It is funny to have this before a story but I have seen reviews for other not for children, children stories and it amazes me that some people will still read those to small children and then blame the author their child cried and had night mares.This story is about a little boy who wanders into the dark forest looking for emo bunnies. I was giggling already at the thought of a pouty sad emo bunny. On his quest he gets lost and stumbles upon Zachary who is a zombie. He was cursed by the witch he works for so his soul is still within his decaying body. This makes him empathetic and no the brainless killing machine most zombies are.This was a lot of fun and I am glad I read it. I will be looking into more of this author's works.

"This is the second in a series. The first is The Diamond Heartstone.PLOT: Prince Jorel has been pressured by his father into finding his mate. They use the mysterious woman known as the Traveller to find her. His mate happens to be Allyson Gray, a police officer investigating the disappearance of Alysia James. Jorel travels to her dimension to bring her home.PROS: It had it's good moments.CONS: Allyson was so annoying. It's one thing to be strong and tough, but Allyson took it to the point that I wanted to hit her. Frankly, I don't even know why Jorel was needed for this story. The author basically neutered him. Ally does all the fighting and saving. I don't object to a strong female lead. I don't object to a woman saving herself. What I object to mostly was that he couldn't even have a simple conversation with this prickly, irritable woman.More realism was needed. I accept another dimension with shapeshifting people, but human nature should still be the same. Allyson comes to this new dimension with very few questions. I think it would be natural to be full of questions and wonder at this new world.The little detail about Alysia James gets abandoned or forgotten. Ally never finds her. I mention this because I don't feel like I'm spoiling a key plot point here. Ally never mentions Alysia again after she's kidnapped by Jorel.2 STARS: I had to force myself to finish this one.

There were some issues, similar to my experience with CONCRETE UNDERGROUND, where in the end, I wasn't sure what was the truth of the situation.  Likewise with this book.  Add to the experience that I just didn't think the story stayed as strong and compelling as CU was for the most part, and I didn't like many of the characters.  There were parts where the formatting and proofreading weren't so good and at least one place where the character who is gagged suddenly starts speaking without having the gag removed.

Unlike most books with similar theme, this one doesn't get into the realm of disbelief where a regular guy can all of a sudden do super things. Rather, when he gets hit in the head he goes down. He has never fired a gun before, he is nervous and doesn't have accuracy. He is still a real man.Spyware is a fairly simple book and a breeze to get through. It starts off a little bit slow to introduce the characters and scenario, but one the action starts it keeps going until the end. While it is semi-predictable where things are heading, there are of course a few twists to throw the reader in a different direction. Nothing groundbreaking in this book, just a fun action book that you can read without thinking too much. I recommend this to anyone that is into the ""chased while trying to solve the crime"" type of novel.","A fun take on the ""hunted and hunter"" genre",1367884800,0,0
This book was difficult to read because of the editing - on every single page words were separated in the middle of the text - such asin sis tent  -  com pan ion  -  de fence less - sometimes I had to read the line twice to figure out what went where. But aside from that I enjoyed the book - it had romance and intrigue. Laura and Ford both suffered so much in the 7 years they were separated and just as they find each other again something terrible separates them all over again. I loved the interaction with her sisters and all of the people in the village close to their estate. If you can get past the editing you'll enjoy it.,The Virgin Bride,1372982400,2,2
"Argus is in a dead-end job, with a crappy living situation and an uneventful life. He is largely absent from the world, choosing not to interact with his many roommates, and having little experience with quality human interaction. That is, this is Argus' life until now. A mysterious encounter with a stranger leaves Argus with a strange box filled with seemingly unrelated artifacts. He doesn't know what it all means, and, with an absent family and no real friends, he doesn't have anyone to ask. When one of his roommates reaches out to him in kindness one night and notices the odd collection, the roommates set out on an adventure to discover the meaning behind the mystery.Tom Lichtenberg has written a short novel that is both appealing and spellbinding as you discover clues right along with Argus. The desire to figure out the meaning behind the box of items keeps you reading until the end. That ending, however, felt somewhat abrupt and rushed, and was a bit of a disappointment after the path of discoveries. It is hinted that this experience has left Argus changed, and I would have liked a little more information about that change and what impact it might have. I wanted to know more about what happened to the other characters at the end as well. I wanted a little more, and I would be interested in further stories in this same vein.The writing style is unique, but well-suited to this type of unconventional story. The character of Argus is fairly well-developed. He is a very insular man who has very few authentic interactions with others, preferring to spend endless hours alone with his own thoughts. There is just enough information given to make you wonder more about Argus' family, as well as his experiences with others growing up. Some of this backstory may well be included in ""Snapdragon Alley,"" a prequel of sorts to this book, where Argus' older brother holds center stage. I also want to know much more about the character of Fulsom. How did he end up needing to be ""in charge"" of the situation presented at the end?MotherLode blog",Engaging and fun!,1291420800,2,2

The fish keep dying, so she has to go back. She and the guy fall for each other.However, the novella feels like the first draft of a story that was published with little editing.

I know most people don't care about grammar like I do, but even my sister, who read the book before me, said she felt the book had been written in a hurry.Fans of Erynn Mangum will enjoy the storyline, but the grammar mistakes create a jumbled mess of words and distract from the story. :(I finished this book a while ago, but I didn't have the heart to post a negative review for an author I love.",Disappointed fan!,1314835200,9,9

"I really enjoyed this book by Lanie Kincaid, but I have to say the description listed here and the cover art do not match the story at all. The storyline of heroine Rae Madison being ""the other woman"" is over in a heartbeat and not central at all to the story. What this story is about is something many daters can relate to: that of friends falling for each other. I liked the way Colby and Rae tried to understand their feelings and dealt with their fear of making a fool of themselves.Despite this, I thought there were many parts of this book that needed some editing. The ""other woman"" storyline in the beginning, for example. It's mentioned and then not really dealt with again. Rae's interaction with Colby's mother is another example. The woman is very influential in this story but there doesn't seem to be a connection between her and Rae. I also felt the ending was rushed, and the quick turnabout in Rae's career felt inauthentic.

This story of what happens after a disaster kills off most of humanity, and affects the very fabric of the reality of those left, lacks any continuity, and reads like a series of unconnected vignettes.It is so badly written that your mind wanders as you read it.

While this book has wonderful illustrations to gain the reader's attention, I felt as though there were not enough illustrations to be deemed as a Comic Book or Graphic Novel.

"Updated from March 12, 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine, Catherine is in a miserable marriage.  She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.",Romance and adultery are not the same thing,1331337600,31,31
"I'm guessing that this was the first Abigail Strom book published, as her usual strengths of writing quality, believable characters and realistic dialogue were not up to snuff. Her usual weakness of not having enough story was there in spades, however. This book was so short, I basically read it in an afternoon, and there was a premise here that could have been explored more deeply, leaving the reader more satisfied. Even the love scene fell flat, and then he left her at the hotel, and she had to find her own way home? Really? The ending was totally rushed,as was the character growth. Time to re-work this one, Abigail, for the digital market.

"Simon Royle had a great idea for a novel that touches on the trend toward loss of personal privacy. Unfortunately, the execution of the idea is not up to the same level as the idea.First, the writing overall is stilted. For the first half of the book, I actually believed that the author was not a native English speaker. Then I looked him up online and discovered that he was born and raised in Manchester, England. I don't know if the problem was all the terminology he used to make the story seem futuristic or that he is just a beginning writer and hasn't found his voice yet. This didn't stop me from reading, but it did decrease my enjoyment level.Second, some of the major characters really are just stereotypes that are barely fleshed out. Jonah, the protagonist, is allowed to speak to the reader in first person, but he is the only character that rises to the level of full development. The worst offender, and possibly the most important character to the storyline, is Gabriel. This book would have been so much stronger if we'd had scenes in which Gabriel was given the first person POV to address us. As written, however, his climactic letter to the world comes across as impossibly naive, as does the global portion of the  ending.Third, the author created some really clever jargon for this world that created a real sense of place and time that is outside of our own. It was never difficult to figure out what the jargon meant, but unfortunately, some of the jargon words he created were crazy hard to pronounce, even though they were just 2 syllables long. Kudos for the idea and the consistent execution of it.Finally, I need to say that I received a free copy of this book in exchange for writing a review.",A compelling idea isn't enough to make a great book,1314403200,19,19

"First of all let's look at what makes USA Today readable in its print version:It is concise,well written and tries to cover all the major international,national and domestic news stories in an easy to read, user friendly format. It may not offer the intellectual brooding of papers like the NY Times but it also does not trivialize news like the New York tabloids.The USA Today just gives us the basics.In this regard it is ideally suited for the Kindle since the paper's format makes it easy to catalog and present news in its simplest form.The only reasons it gets 4 stars:1. The price needs to be lower since it is not published on weekends.2. I still am reserving the 5th star for the day when technology can make Kindle incorporate graphics,comics,crossword puzzles etc;",Ideally suited for the Kindle,1322438400,2,2

"I had read the first book in the Second Sons Inquirary Agency mystery series, ""The Vital Principle"" and was intrigued by the main character, Knighton Gaunt, the agency's founder. I wanted to read more about him and his agency and so purchased this book.  Unfortunately, he rarely appears.Sir Edward is involved in the death of his former mistress and hires Gaunt to investigate.  Edward's  nephew,  Charles Vance, becomes involved and it is he who appears throughout the book searching out clues, traveling about the countryside and eventually catching the murderer.  One gets the feeling that Gaunt belives that Sir Edward is guilty and can't be bothered.In the story, a romance develops between Charles and Ariadne Wellfleet, a florist,  who helps him in his investigations.  The murderer taunts the investigators by sending roses whose names indicate the next victim.  Her father, before dying, betrothed her to a man whom she loathes.From the start I found many of the plot lines rather silly. Charles finds a homeless waif on the streets, takes her to the house of a woman whom he has never met (Ariadne)  and she immediately takes the waif in. Most of the other plot lines seem equally far fetched.I can only hope that Sir Edward never paid Gaunt a dime for his non-investigation.  This is a Second Sons Inquirary Agency mystery novel in name only.",Not a true novel in the series,1344816000,1,1
"Will and Ethan are highschool mate friends. For all the years of the school they were inseparable, then Ethan went far away for college but they remained best friends and sometimes Ethan turned back home to see Will. And for Will was pain and pleasure cause Will was deeply in love with his friend and had no courage to admit it, especially not to Ethan who seemed to have plenty of women around him.But one night, maybe thanks to some much drinks, Will and Ethan confess thier mutual feelings, and make passionate love. Will also declares his love to Ethan. But the morning after, Ethan has to leave in a hurry, and can't explain to Will why and where and doesn't know when he will be back. He only asks to Will to never let go him and his love for him.But Ethan can return only three years after, without any words in between, and Will has not maintain his promise, he has let go and he has moved on, try to find someone else... but this is not true, cause his love for Ethan is not dead and flares to new life when his lover is again near him.

Will and Ethan are first friends and then lovers, and this allow them to be able to trust themself without much words to explain the past.

"This book had a good premise, the flow however was kind of all over the place for me, and the way the characters never really finished conversations instead the author told you what was being said.  I like how the author wanted to keep the readers in suspense and she did that, while adding in a little confusion as well lol, but I also like how the suspense was answered.  I have to say of all the characters in the book, the only one I actually liked was Sydney.  Armani and Viper were crazy sickos to me, especially Viper he was sick in the head and Tarianna was not a good friend and she was a money hungry skank so maybe she deserved Viper.  All of the secrets that go full circle was mind boggling and poor Sydney doesn't know she's in a pit surrounded by snakes.  Though I know they all love her, none of them deserve her not even Armani.  I couldn't understand or even remotely like any of the male characters, Armani got close at least he has a heart somewhat I guess.  The females with the exception of Sydney were trifling.  What was the purpose in Armani going back to the streets again??? Why won't Viper try to do something legit? Instead they both continually lie causing the cycle to repeat itself all over again smh.

Great concept - but just too short to really deliver. Men who have nothing after Katrina - this is a story that should really pull at the heartstrings.

"I confess it's difficult to convey in a few short words just how utterly bad this novel really is!The premise is certainly sound enough and, frankly, that's what prompted me to pick up this. The second coming of the Christian Messiah is at hand as a result of the deeply undercover cloning of Christ's DNA from blood recovered from the Shroud of Turin by a group of religious separatists known as the Vinces.THE SON OF MAN is clearly Christian fiction and one doesn't have to hunt very hard to see the clear parallels to the biblical story of the birth of God's son - the nativity star is represented by a rogue asteroid on a collision path with earth; the immaculate conception is presented via the impregnation of illegally cloned cells into a young virgin; the trek to Bethlehem is re-created as the struggle to reach Omaha, Nebraska, the anticipated ground zero of the collision with the asteroid; and the gift-bearing magi make an appearance as a kindly doctor and a Nobel Laureate physicist. There's even a John the Baptist character who ensures that nothing stands in the way of the birth of ""the Father's only begotten son"".I'll hand one kudo (and one kudo only) to CW Johnson. He definitely has the writing chops to create first rate suspense when it comes to describing the impending apocalypse that would be caused by collision of a mountainous asteroid with the heartland of America. Frankly, that's the only reason I actually finished this dog-eared mutt. But that's it! From a purely writing point of view, the plot is seriously disjointed and outrageously difficult to follow, sub-plots are willy-nilly injected and summarily dropped and the characters are cartoonish and thinly developed. Maria, for example, the stand-in for the mother of Christ on this second stab at converting the world, is a virgin only because she's a neurotic, egocentric,waspish whiner that no self-respecting man would stay with long enough to roll into bed.If one examines this novel from a thematic point of view, the theology is a joke and is an excellent example of the many reasons why I am a rabidly anti-Christian deist hanging tentatively by my fingernails on the edge of atheism. (And I know I'm not alone) That a self-centered, narcissistic God would make a second appearance to the world because we screwed up the receipt of his first message and failed to give him his due obeisance; that he would choose to make his appearance through the worldly efforts of a renegade group of arrogant theologians convinced that the end justifies their illegal means; that he would enlist a pederast, murderers, thugs, drug runners and extortionists as his advance earthly agents; that this so-called God would create havoc, mayhem, destruction, heartbreak, chaos and the foundation for a world-wide nuclear war as the climate for his second coming ... well, it's all more than laughable. It's the reason why there is so much antipathy today toward organized religion in general and Christianity in particular.If that's the God that Christian dogma has on offer, then give me the apocalypse but leave me alone after I'm dead and gone. That's one God that I don't care to ever meet.Paul Weiss",That this represents a major world religion is a terrifying reality!,1338163200,7,7

I liked that she flash forwarded a couple of months to make a growing romance easier to digest-I hate when characters fall in love in an hour.

"More like a 3.5The premise is neat and original. The characters well developed, but the heroine protested, much, much, much too long.

"This is a five minute or so long short story revolving around a guy who stepped on an unexploded shell from the past.  The blast damaged his leg and killed his partner and sending him into deep depression.  He therefore blames his now useless foot for causing the misery that is his current life by stepping on the explosive, and all that he has lost.  Well meaning friends and family have put up a Christmas tree which only torments him more as doing this sort of this was a highlight of his relationship and a reminder of what his foot has taken away from him.  Amputees often talk of a phantom limb where they can feel their leg itching and the like, however his leg seems to be walking around and tormenting him further.It was an okay read, at times it contradicted itself, he is dragging the bad foot along at the start of the story, later he tells us he asked doctors to have the foot amputated but that this didn't happen, but then the next sentence he is referring to a plastic foot.  Maybe York had written the tale both ways and just forgot to delete that part.

"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half. The people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lay in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall, black-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.During a three-month stay at the Citadel, Reaper Cyner Cree has paid penance for taking Aingeal as his mate and giving her one of his ""hellions,"" making her a Reaper without the Shadowlords' permission. The married couple return to their new home in Haines City, where the people have surprisingly welcomed them with open arms and are happy to hear that Aingeal is pregnant. But all is not well in Oklaks Territory.Two men the Reaper thought he'd killed - Otaktay, the Jakotai brave who still wants Aingeal back, and the Rogue Silus Gibbs - remain alive and pose a danger to them. However, they're not the only or even the worst threat facing the couple and the Territory Cyner has vowed to protect. The evil Ceannus have returned with more of their creations, rogues more dangerous than the ones that came before. And the Ceannus have let loose another danger, one Terrans cannot survive. One that could bring Cynyr and his fellow Reapers to their knees.WesternWind 2: Reaper's Revenge continues where WyndRiver Sinner left off. Although it can be read as a stand alone novel, I recommend reading the books in order for the most enjoyment; i.e. grasp of character development and the colorful ""MegaVerse"" that Charlotte Boyett-Compo has created for, not only this series, but for all her others. You'll get better acquainted with the other Reapers, the ""Texas Rangers"" of this new west, as they join Cyn to protect Haines City from the evil that threatens all of Terra. You'll also get more insight into the folks of Haines City, particularly the cheeky, outspoken Moira, who will have you in stitches as she and Aingeal lead the matchmaking efforts to bring together the Sheriff's daughter Danielle Brewster and the impervious Prime Reaper Arawn Gehdrin, who are the featured couple in book 3, Prime Reaper.Although I've always loved WyndRiver Sinner with a passion, this second installment to the series is an absolute thrill ride. Fast-paced and packed with absorbing action, the unexpected twists and turns will surprise and intrigue you from start to finish. The subplots keep the story rolling, and Ms. Boyett-Compo's sweeping descriptions will engross you. As always, her love scenes are as hot, as sweet and as smooth as melted butter. Add a touch of her light humor, and simply put, this book is thoroughly enjoyable.Even if you're not a futuristic cowpunk fan, this series offers other themes that will draw you in in a heartbeat.

"This is a very difficult review to write.  Sisypuss:  Memoirs of a Vagabond Cat by Patricia Halloff is, by any definition, quite an emotional story, and in reading the work, it took quite a lot out of me.  The story is just what the title would indicate; a story of a stray and unwanted cat.  Now folks, be warned.  This is not one of those ""kitty is born, wonders around having adventures, has some hardships, has some fun, and is finally adopted by a loving little girl and lives happily ever after"" kind of book; far, far from it! First though, a brief look at the story line.  I have to be careful here as I do not want any spoilers.Sisypuss is born to a stray mother cat, a mother of many litters who is on the edge of death.  The birth takes place in a cold, filthy unused dog house.  The entire story is told through the eyes of our leading character, Sisypuss.  It is a cat's eye view of the world, a stray cat, an unwanted cat.  Sisypuss is by nature, an optimistic cat, and is always willing to see things in their best light.  The story takes us through a world that is all around us, but one which many have never had a glimpse, nor, for that matter, ever imagined.  From an over burdened animal shelter, to a horrible compound where animals are kept before being sold to ""research"" facilities, into the actual facility (yes, these places do exist, I have had dealings with them), to the open fields, woods and city streets.  This is a grim tale indeed.Ms. Patricia Halloff is an excellent writer.  There is absolutely no doubt she knows and understands the nature of cats. With this work the author is not only giving us a story, but she is making a rather strong statement about animal treatment in this country.  Actually, ""strong"" might not be a strong enough word, come to think of it.  She has been most effective in this effort.  She has used some rather strong street language in this work, but certainly has not used it gratuitously, and she has used it quite effectively.  The author also seems to have the ability to nail the character of many people quite well.  There is not one human character in this work that does not have at least a dozen ""clones"" in every community.  I could introduce you to dozens of them in my area alone.  Historians, sociologists and anthropologists have long pointed out that one of the benchmarks of any advanced society or civilization is how they treat their animals.  I fear we need to take a very close look at ourselves.  I know for myself, one of the first characteristics in any person I meet is how they treat animals and what their attitude is toward them. Now me, being me, if the people I meet do not hit my particular, personal standard, they sort of end up off my ""list"" of people I have anything to do with what-so-ever.  Hey, this is just me though. This work, for me, reinforces my belief that this is a good policy on my part.This is not a pleasant ""feel good"" read my any means.  I can almost promise you that you will feel quite uncomfortable reading it; at least I hope you do.  If you don't, then there is something horribly wrong with you, and you probably need to seek some sort of help.  Now sometimes books that make us feel uneasy are the best kind of books.  They cause us to think.  They can cause us to take action.  They can direct us in the right direction.  They can make us aware of problems that we really do not want to know about, but should.  This is one of those books. When you read this book, it is going to stick with you for a long, long time...I promise!  There are times when it simply is not appropriate to stick your head in the sand and hope it all goes away.This is a very well written book.  The syntax is a bit different, but that is sort of ""my thing"" and I delighted in it.  The story is strong and very well told.  The author is an absolute natural story teller.  The characters quite believable and the messages are not only important, but rather urgent.  I highly recommend this one. It should also be noted that proceeds from this book are being given to organizations fighting animal abuse.","THIS ONE WILL STAY WILL STAY WITH YOU A LONG, LONG TIME!",1210118400,36,36
"I loved this book! Great action and the storyline and characters were well written. Melina Dmitros is the Captain of a starship. The Alliance has just entered into an agreement with the Prime one of the oldest species in space and Melina has just received a call for help from a Prime star cruiser. Going to their help she finds the priate ship dead in space with minimal emergency life support but has to board the Prime ship because she cannot contact them. The priates have boarded the Prime ship Galanti and are trapped by the Prime warriors but the prime warriors are also trapped in their engine room and defending their ship from the pirates.Melina is very knowledgeable of Prime history and has also learned their language from her parents. Melina leads a team into the Prime ship and secures the docking bay. Working her way through the maintenance ducts she is able to reach the prime crew and help rescue the ship - more importantly the Captain of the Galanti recognizes her as his mate and that she is actually a Prime citizen herself.There were many grammatical errors, extra words added but the story was so engrossing they weren't too annoying.

"Well, this book is a lot like its title. Obvious and silly. Old geezers trying to stop the development of their trailer park in Florida.  It is really ridiculous, but aside from the old man crushed In the commercial trash compactor not much harm done.As I was reading it I could not help but notice the similarity to the wonderfully ridiculous plots of Carl Hiaasen who writes constantly about crooked developers and politicians in Florida.  But comparing this author to Hiaasen  be like comparing William Shakespeare to Danielle Steele.  I will leave you to decide which would be which.The book is ok for passing a couple of hours, but I can't imagine actually reading any more of the series.

"We should all be familiar with alternate worlds - most fiction movies or literary works that describe the present or the near future are worlds that deviate from our own in small, subtle ways - for example, the movie itself and the actors playing the parts do not exist there - or may be significant variations to what we think our world is supposed to be like - think Indiana Jones and his magical artifacts.I wish I could hint at the plot of the story and then state that I will not spoil it but a story this short doesn't have much of a plot. There's a war most of us heard of and a few minutes in the miserable life of one, anonymous actor, or warrior. The charming part, and this is what earns the story its stars is the easy, smooth, almost imperceptible transition from what appears in the beginning to be 'historical fiction' to what turns out to be something completely different.I stated in my review that this is only a teaser not because I know for a fact that it is but because I can't see any other reason why the story would be written. ""In the Trenches"" could stands its own in the pages of Analog or, better, the ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" magazine but, even there, the readers would be unhappy if they learned that this wasn't the precursor of some large, expansive series of works mapping that strange universe for our wonderment and reading pleasure.Based on the teaser, I'd buy the 'big book' if and when it comes out.","This is a teaser, this is only a teaser",1243728000,2,2

"This little tract is likely to be more frustrating than anything else.  It's from the Rand Company and is dated 2003, and I assume that somewhere someone did some actual research with a good report at the end of it, but what you get here is the equivalent of someone's bulleted slide presentation.It talks ever-so-briefly about Biological, Chemical and Nuclear attack, but generally won't be useful unless one of these events takes place close to your place of work.  It tells you, for example, ""[I]f attack is indoors, follow chemical attack plans specific to your building.""  Whoop.And yet, its not entirely without interest.  One thing I thought was interesting was their reference to smallpox.  As you know smallpox is a disease that's been eradicated and only exists in labs in the US and Russia.  Hmm.The other thing I learned, which I hadn't thought about, is that if there's a nuclear attack, and one happens to be around tall buildings, one should get to as high a floor as possible, as long as it's also 3 stories beneath the roof.  Thus you'd be above contamination on the ground, and away from radioactive dust that will land on the roof.But generally, I don't think most people are going to find this to be 3-Stars.

"Novella length urban fantasy along the lines of Butcher's Dresden.I like this authors style. It has such a devil may care attitude to it and that is exactly how he has written his main character. With the debonnaire flair of  an outcast gentleman and the sarcastic wit of a person who doesn't give a flying monkey what anyone says or thinks.A few minor errors, one being the use of the word reign instead of reins.Other than that this is quite an excellent read, just a shame it isn't a full length novel. Saying that though novellas often feel 'interrupted' for wont of a better word and this doesn't, it fits snugly and ends well.

"The Amazon product page for this book is worthless as an introduction to or description of what you'll find when you download this book and read it. Maybe this will help. Here is a more or less randomly selected excerpt:""The novel will consist of many parts. Each of these is called a chapter. The chapters will be very small. Each chapter will focus on one, and only one, aspect of the novel. The chapters will be short because I do not have much time. I can only write in short bursts and I am easily bored.""Now, I have loved this stuff since the 60's, from William S. Burroughs on the left coast to Donald Barthelme in New York, by way of Texas. It's all called ""postmodern"", but since the early 70's we've all been heading toward post-postmodernism anyway. If you find this kind of fiction at all agreeable, you should try some Lichtenberg.For what it's worth this seems a little bit old school, and I mean that in a good way. A lot of the current work is too showy and too cute-clever. A lot of it is navel gazing and lame, maybe even spineless. Lichtenberg's work has a little more muscle. Even as he playfully suggests, over and over, that you are in charge of the reading experience as the reader, he is actually in total control of what's going on and of what you are experiencing. You are being entertained, educated and manipulated. You are being experimented on, but it will feel good, (like a lab experiment that activates the pleasure centers of your brain.)But all of this is way too heavy. This is meant on at least some level to be fun and it is. There are some marvelous turns of phrase; some playful deception; a lot of joy and a bit of subtle aggression. There is much here to think about or to just appreciate. This is a great find.I would certainly encourage you to take a look at this and see what you think.

This item is being offered for free, but the time you waste reading it will be precious minutes of your own life squandered -- unless you are interested in MLM, or network marketing.I hate giving bad reviews even when deserved, and so it gives me no great pleasure to say that this is not so much a book that will help you with your desire to start a home-based business, but a thinly disguised, lengthy sales letter designed to direct you to the author's web site.I'll toss one scrap of credit to the author: She provides a fairly good outline of how to vet a MLM company for its value, and gives some advice on what to avoid -- because as we all know, the vast majority of MLM ""opportunities"" are scams. The author claims her chosen network marketing vehicle is different-- again, let the buyer beware.One of the most egregious aspects of this ""book"" is that the author offers scads of statistics concerning the nature of jobs, the work place, home business success, etc. -- yet not one of them are attributed to a source!

"Every once in a while you'll come across a book which confounds the supposed laws of convention by taking its own road. Erik Gustafson's novel ""Fall Leaves and the Black Dragon"" did that for me.I trudged through the first half of the novel, working through our narrator's clumsy teenager voice. That's how teenagers sound, think and act - and I get that, but it wasn't easy. The first half of the book is the recounting of William's nightmarish childhood. He and a friend had been playing with matches (or so they thought), resulting in a fire that left his friend horribly burned. William's parents soon moved the family out of state, and only upon his graduation from high school did they confess that his friend had actually died in the fire - along with his mother - but had kept that awful truth from him all those years.Calling himself Liam now and trying to solve the nightmares and visions that have plagued him since that fateful fire, he and a new friend take an adventurous road trip and travel back to his former home, seeking answers. What they find are more questions. Eventually, they do find the answers they seek, as well as redemption for more than just Liam.Ultimately, I am glad to have taken this journey with Liam and the cast of characters because it was such an interesting book, and a compelling payoff. I loved what the author did with the plot twists and turns. There are some well thought-out and imaginative ideas here that I was very impressed with and commend Gustafson for.

"Kaya is a shape-shifter, and having been left behind by her family she's spent most of her life as a cougar in the wild. She's been watching Jericho and Hunter, two men who live in an isolated cabin, and they have been watching her. When she is hurt, she allows them to help her--and they discover that their wild cougar companion is in fact a beautiful woman. They both form an attachment to her, and are reluctant to leave her even when their work calls them away.I liked that the plot was slow and mellow. It has a quiet, isolated feel that I found relaxing. It isn't an adventure story, and the paranormal element is uncomplicated and matter-of-fact. That simplicity really fit the story and set the tone.While reading this story, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how the author intended to characterize each of her protagonists. Kaya comes across as a bit weak and helpless, but then you have to bare in mind that she hasn't had much human contact. Still, I feel like the author could have spent a little time establishing that Kaya does have some innate strength, and isn't totally dependent on her men to provide for her. Hunter is portrayed as the more closed off, emotionally isolated of the two men. Why that is is never fully explained. I can't really get a handle on Jericho's personality at all, other than that he's a bit more open than Hunter. Both men are, of course, insanely protective and intent on caring for Kaya. I think part of the problem at work here is page limitation. It's a short book, so there is only a limited amount of time to establish everyone's personality and allow them to develop.My other ""complaint"" is the sunny, slightly sugar coated ending. Everyone is accepting of Kaya and her relationship with two men. Nobody comments or thinks it's odd. Everybody is just part of a big happy family. That's a bit unrealistic. But then, this book has shape-shifting so I guess I shouldn't demand realism.All told, for a novella you can read in one day, this is worthwhile. It has steam, emotion, and a fairly satisfying happy ending. 3.5 stars.",A Cougar and Two Mates,1314576000,3,3

"I'm the type of person who loves paranormal mystery novels, but this fell short. It was paranormal (ghosts) and it was a mystery (who is the killer?), but the story seemed to drone on and on and focus on tangents that didn't add to the plot. The characters were naive and the main character, Chelsea, was weak and kind of an idiot for being touted as being from a notoriously strong, independent family that takes care of themselves.Some parts of the book were genuinely interesting and I didn't want to put it down, but then the ending to the excitement always fell flat.Then there's a specific scene when Chelsea is on the phone with Bob when the camera ""surprises"" her (I hate spoilers so I'm leaving it vague), but I seriously laughed out loud. My husband asked me if I was reading a comedy. ""I don't think it's supposed to be,"" I answered. Ridiculous.Why three stars?

"Sometimes less is more and this story could do with a lot less going on in it.The story of shifters versus Knights, who are trained humans that control and suppress the shifters and let's not forget the ultimate villain Vesper, who just wants to rule them all. There are three storylines, Gabe the Knight and accidentially becomes what his father hates most, Emma and her siblings looking for Dr. Draco and Cat also Draco's child, but seeking revenge for being abandoned. So in essence you have enough plots for multiple books and that is exactly what is wrong with this book, it is too much and too many. It was like an ecstacy fueled rollercoaster riding through the world of fantasy. It was from A to Z to D to 100 and back. There are some great ideas in this book the author just needs to center on some of them, create a little more depth and maybe save some of it for the next book. It doesn't warrant two stars, because when the writer slows down in the middle (now and again, for a page or two) you can see that there is the possibility of a solid book in there.

"When Reaper Eanan Tohre is brought to the Citadel, he doesn't know what lies ahead for him. He's not aware of having done anything wrong, but he still feels uncomfortable. And he's horny. Being a Reaper means it is easy to find a woman more than willing to help him with his needs. Why he's been summoned and placed before the three Gatekeepers of the Citadel is something he's not been told, and the stares from the beautiful women make him more than a little uncomfortable. The information they give to him is more than shocking, and it takes a little time to convince him it's true. Time they are more than willing to spend on the man.Embrace the Wind was a tantalizing taste into Charlotte Boyett-Compo's world of Reapers. This story is better read in the order of the series.

He yearns to make her the love of his life and the mother of his children.  When he finds out she is moving back to town, his heart jumps for joy, all the while knowing that she probably won't even look at a man like him.Veronica Abbott has to get out from under her parents control, even though she has been married and widowed.  Moving back to her hometown, she decides to open a romance shop.  Taking a basket to the local fire department as a thank you for saving her childhood home from burning down, Veronica walks into the locker room and comes face to face with Dean Wolcott; the object of her secret teenage crush.  Veronica then proceeds to show him just how much she has missed him and is attracted to him.Dean wants Veronica with every ounce of his being.  He doesn't want to be her part time lover, he wants to be the love of her life forever.  He promises to give her time but is unsure if a girl like her will ever love him.Caught Off Guard was a naughty look at two people whose childhood crushes were still alive and strong years later.

"A meteor containing alien life forms hits the small, rural town of Peculiar, MO.  A few Peculiar inhabitants begin experiencing strange dreams and visions.  Animals begin acting wildly.  The lives of several Peculiar residents are linked together in this suspenseful, science fiction novel.I enjoyed this novel because it was suspenseful in parts, had well developed characters and was very well written.For the most part, the book was suspenseful and a page turner.  I had to get to the next page, chapter and definitely had to find out how it all ended!  However, there were some scenes that I felt were too long or drawn out.  This took away from some of the scenes.  I especially felt this way near the end of the book where I think it was filled with too much description.  I felt it was slower-paced with lots of explanation that was not necessary.  That being said, I want to reiterate that there was good suspense and at no point did I want to stop reading or skip to the end.I felt the book was a bit gory.  I expected a science fiction novel but this was a hybrid - mostly science fiction with a few pages of gore.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I wouldn't take off any stars, but it's just good for a reader to know.  It's now tagged as ""horror"" as well and I think that tag wasn't there when I purchased the book.I was a little disappointed with Rachel's storyline.  I wanted to know more about her link to the unspeakable crime in the past.  Without giving anything away here, I suppose I expected more resolution on that side story regarding said crime.The characters were great.  I felt connected to all of them and I could empathize with them.  I cared about what happened to them and wanted to see how the story turned out for each and every one of them.  I enjoyed being on an adventure with these characters.  I'd go on another one with them.  I think I would have liked to see Gordon more developed but maybe that was the point - he was supposed to be a bit mysterious.  I enjoyed (for the most part) the character of Rollins.  He was a bit uneven but I liked that.  I liked how the point of view changed.  It wasn't hard to follow and the reader gets to experience the storylines of the different characters.There was a lot of science in the book.  I have no idea if it was accurate or not but there was a lot of scientific description that was way over my head.  Thankfully one of the characters felt the same way :-) so another character regularly  explained the science behind the aliens.  However, it was still a lot for my taste.

"I like mysteries, cozy or otherwise, whether they are short-story ones or full-length novels. So, I was looking forward to this.Three Sisters is a short forty-four-page mystery, which introduces us to Emily Castle. She attends a neighbourhood party in a large house inhabited by a rather flamboyant group of people. This is where a murder takes place and Emily dons her sleuthing hat to find the culprit; there are a number of suspects amongst the motley crew of party-goers.I found that the story was too short for the plot and characters, both of which were undeveloped. The characters were very colourful, their situation--albeit bizarre--rather interesting and deserved more attention. I really wanted to know more about Emily and how she found herself to be modern-day Miss Marple, and there were many unanswered questions behind the nature of her relationships with the party attendees, as well as between the attendees themselves. Unfortunately, the whole mystery was spoiled by the fact that half way through I realised the title gave away the plot, and I was less motivated to finish the tale.Helen's style is light and easy-going, and this was a story with great potential, but I would like to see it in a full-length novel with more detail and perhaps with a more enigmatic title.","Great story, but lacks detail",1358380800,0,0

But the whole thing is contrived and really dumb.  The end reminded me of the kind of ending my students used to tack on to a story when they didn't know how to end it:  they said, in effect, ""and then I died.""  It didn't matter that I would point out to them that if that were the case, they couldn't have told the story.  They just liked the shock value.  So it is with this story, I think.

"Set in and around a hospital in Medford Oregon, Ian Fox's Promise me Eternity tells the stories of criminals, self-absorbed doctors, unfaithful wives, ambitious girlfriends, broken homes and wounded childhoods all rolled into one. With so many flawed characters it was hard sometimes to settle into reading--each new scene feeling like an accident waiting to happen. Promise Me Eternity is not a comfortable book or a quick read, but it does have a soap-opera allure as it meanders from hospital to rich man's home, from bedroom to operating theater, and from FBI agent's files to doctor's notes. The ending returns fairly satisfyingly to the start and leaves the reader to enjoy the company of one honest protagonist and kind relationship.There's a nice hint of mystery in the well-chosen first scene that keeps the reader turning pages, but the large cast of characters can sometimes be confusing and multiple backstories seemed a little distracting and slow. Hospital scenes with neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists never quite felt convincing to me, which may say more about my interests than my knowledge. Meanwhile dogged investigators chip at the edges of the tale, slipping in and out at inopportune moments.A long dark tale with tortured characters and cruel twists of fate, this novel blends medical mystery, psychological drama, thriller, suspense, action, romance and more, fitting something for everyone into the tale of man who'd like to save the world if the world would only let him.Disclosure: I received a free ecopy of this novel from the author in exchange for my honest review.",A tale of unfulfilled promises,1344902400,0,0
"This ebook was supplied to me free to read and review.This book grabbed me from the first page, although the plot is unlikely, to put it mildly, where everyone can seemingly be bought if the price is right. Eric the main character by an initial misfortune gets involved with drug smuggling and as his daughter is threatened he has no choice but to continue. Eric works his way up the drug smuggling organisation and although extreme violence and high body count the violence is almost so over the top that it just adds to the atmosphere rather than shocks. All of the characters are well developed and the plot is quite straightforward although there is a twist at the end it again does not seem likely.Summary an action packed book where you have to suspend belief but very readable with some good ideas. If you like smuggling, gang warfare, murders and extortion you will like this.",Fast Paced,1332892800,1,1

"I personally love it when two authors I respect come together on a collaborative work. Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn come together in the novel Serial.  The novel is a story of hitchhiking at it most terrifying.  Everyone knows that hitchhiking is dangerous, but this novel follows what happens when one truly depraved person picks up another truly depraved human being.  The novel was written in an odd fashion with Kilborn writing the first part and Crouch writing the second with the two of them finishing it over email with 100 - word exchanges without reading what the other person had opened with.  Trust me it makes sense if you ever read it.The Novel Serial is a lot like if Dexter met Dexter but neither one of them had a moral code.  I really enjoyed the novel I just wished it had been longer.  Maybe I'm a little twisted but I would have preferred to at least be rooting for one serial killer over the other.  The characterization is minimal but if you want to have a few disturbing images seared in your mind before bed time this book will deliver.  Hopefully Crouch and Kilborne will attempt a project like this again soon but aim for a full sized novel.  I wish there was more to review but with a story so short and to the point all you need to decide is if you have 2 extra bucks and free hour.",Dexter meets Dexter,1310515200,0,0

"Gandhi's story was a bit long-winded, and he talked so self-righteously about himself at times to the point of annoying-ness...some things he talked about (i.e. his diet) I found quite irrelevant. It was interesting to read that he was married at a very young age - I never knew that, and the complexities of that marriage made him seem more real. There were points where I almost felt he looked down on black South Africans, like it was wrong for white South-Africans to treat Indians poorly, but a totally different story all together with how they treated Black people (i.e. one night he was taking a walk down a South African road and was berated by a white man. One of Gandhi's white friends caught this and got mad at the white man for berating Gandhi. Gandhi said something to the effect of 'Oh forgive him, he just thought I was a black man') - this is paraphrased, but you get the just of it.Still, his determination and fight for Indians to be treated equally was inspirational. His peaceful protests are what eventually inspired Martin Luther King and, to a point, Nelson Mandela, fight for the rights of blacks in America (King) and South Africa (Mandela).

"I tried really hard to get into this book, after all the premise was interesting.  It is about the mythical Priory of Sion who is somehow mixed up in the Templar legend.  However, I quickly lost interest as the author constantly switches between characters.  While this isn't always a bad technique, I just felt that he used the switching technique rather than engage in character building.  As such, I could not feel any connection to the characters and soon lost interest.  Another thing that I found highly annoying was that some of the characters dialogue was in French.  The author would then provide a translation right beside it.  This made it more difficult to get into the dialogue, since it was constantly interrupted by the need for an interpretation.

"Nothing provocative or life-changing. In fact, it seems the authors of the Didache simply cut and paste snippets taken from the New Testament and pasted them into this collection of customs, rules, and regulations.

"Review:Having exposed the Hidden beings - witches, vampires, weres, etc., to the human race, the witches were systematically killed until only one was left.  Hidden in the folds of time, Aradia had no knowledge of where she came from or why she could do the things she could do.  Strange behavior and the struggle to control her powers during her childhood made her a lonely, shy girl.  A move to Salem, MA helps change that.  Strange behavior seems to be the norm in Salem and Aradia finds that she has more in common with many of its residents than she originally thought.In this first book of the series by LA Jones, Tales of Aradia was a story that held my attention throughout.  Aradia goes from that shy, quiet girl to a self-assured young woman as the book progresses, and by the end, she is a force to be reckoned with.  The supporting characters were unusual and interesting, if at times rather unlikable.  As most of them were supposed to be Aradia's enemies, that wasn't surprising.I believe Tales of Aradia has the potential to be a great book.  The idea for the story line was well thought out and clever, but the presentation of it in this book left some room for improvement.  Shifts in writing from different characters' perspectives were at times confusing and hard to follow.  Some unrealistic events even within a paranormal book occurred, such as a young girl being able to bring someone to the police station and put him in a cell overnight without an explanation of how.  There were also jumps in time passed that were unexpected and affected the flow of the book.  A few inconsistencies in facts were also present - for instance, a character is supposed to be in jail and on the next page he is out with no explanations of how he managed to escape.  If the author has the inclination, some short, concise sentences could fix many of these issues.  As a side note - there may be grammatical errors but because self-published authors usually do not have the benefit of professional editing, and conversion of files can affect text when sending electronic review copies, I do not include comments about editing in my reviews.Overall, I give Tales of Aradia three stars because of its potential to become a great series.",The potential for a great series!,1308268800,2,2

"As another reviewer said, this is really a child's story - a rather bloodthirsty child.  Since I'm not a child, I can only give my opinion of it, and I wasn't particularly impressed.  But, to be fair, I'm trying to review it based on the target audience, which I think WILL enjoy it much more than I did.  This is a very short story.  The premise is simple - the little girl does not take good care of her bunny and it starts to grow and grow and grow.  Never a nice bunny, it then begins eating everything in sight.  There is a requisite happy ending although the bunny's own ending is not particularly pleasant (but there is no overt, 'real' violence or gore).This reminded me strongly of some of the original Brothers Grimm fairy tales in the writing style and themes; bad things happened to not-bad people, then the ending was rather vicious but (almost) everyone lived happily ever after. Unlike the more traditional fairy tales, there wasn't really a moral to this story.Definitely a short for the younger set who will appreciate it much more than adults will.

Sort of a Big Misunderstanding idea that was relegated to the background, while the present day Resolution  was a little more like an afterthought.  But in this case the afterthought is what we are reading.  There was also a brief foray into what could have been a I-Am-Man-See-Me-Protect...but it was a false alarm.  Oh well.On the other hand, if you after a quickie read for some explicit steaminess...well this will fit the bill.I found the writing good enough, the premise good enough, and the author gets imagination points, so  I will look at other stories by this author....and if I could I'd be rating it a 3.5.JTG",Steamy snowstorm activity...,1289952000,8,8

"It was more a 3.5 stars but once I finished the book, I found that I was quite fond of the guys, in different ways, so I'll give it 4.I liked Ryan because, even if he knew he was risking his career, he was not willing to search for a compromise. I liked Josh because he was very practical and he found the way to get Ryan and himself out of trouble, showing that he might not be rich, but he was resourceful.The secondary characters were interesting and I liked Ryan's friend, Bill, who is the voice of reason in a very stressful situation. The bad guy behind the tabloid pictures was given a strong homophobic connotation and I thought it was unbelievable that Ryan accepted all the name calling without reacting.The angst was never too much, even in the most difficult moments, because the two characters trusted each other.

As the two get to know each other better while dodging bullets and pursuers, would Alexandra choose Joshua as a mate?

Readers are also left wondering who's foe or friend as there's internal betrayal in the pack.

"I loved this hilarious paranormal story that in turns had me laughing out-loud or fanning myself. This is the second release in the A Biting Love series by the author. I haven't read the first novel but I definitely will now. This was a fabulous read loaded with wonderful characters in a perfect locale. Meiers Corners is a town I'd love to visit if not move to. Elena was such a strong, realistic heroine, I'd really like to be her friend. Viking-type heroes have never really appealed to me but I have to say Bo totally lit my fire. They are perfectly suited to one another, in their wonderful assets and flaws. The secondary characters were so enjoyable. My favorite was Detective Dirk who is so absurdly clueless that I gave myself a sprain from shaking my head at his actions.

"I am not into natural remedies, do not drink herbal teas that taste like grass and would trust pills manufactured in a lab, after careful scientific research into their properties, ten times over a pinch of this mixed with a pinch of that.So I got the book for curiosity sake and for the beauty aspect since, even if I'm not willing to drink teas, I can at least make my own creams and masks.I was disappointed. Out of 52 tips, only a handful concern beauty. The rest is all about treating various ailments, from flu, to asthma, varicose veins, infertility and stress. Most of the tips do tend to reoccur frequently as there are only so many herbs you can use. Ginger, honey, nettles, St-john's wort, rosemary, sage etc. appear on a regular basis.The author is careful to warn you against mixing herbs and conventional medicine and to keep herbal teas out of reach of pregnant or nursing women. The section on how to cure babies should, in my view, be edited out. I find the idea of giving herbal remedies to very young children rather disturbing.Bottom line : If you're into alternative medicine, you will like this book as it will give you a good idea of what herbs to use to cure any given illness.

"When approved to review the book Anabella Giggles All Day! by Dr. Nev Nickels, I was excited because I didn't have any e-books for my daughter on my kindle and the book looked like something she would enjoy, since it's for ages 3-7 and described as easy-to-read rhyme.After I read the 40 page story book a few times, I decided I was pretty disappointed with it. It wasn't very easy to read rhyme, it felt forced and the rhyming just wasn't very good. The characters names (Anabella and Imani) didn't flow well with the text and made it even more difficult to read. I had to re-read parts because I thought it was my fault that it somehow wasn't flowy and rhyming like kids books usually are.Here's an example of what I'm talking about when I say forced:""Happiliy incited and excited,Anabella then said""Imani did you knowyour cheeks are totally red?""And for the not great rhyming:""Yay I did it!Anabella you're cured.You're not laughing too muchor too loudly anymore.""As I'm trying to stay with the book, it takes a turn and jumps from Imani being angry at Anabella, to something call the Rhompees, and then they make up and the book just ends. It was an odd story that didn't have a very good flow and was a bit confusing.Also, I was quite disappointed about the screen set up on the Kindle, two pages of the book would only fill half the screen, making it slightly more difficult to read and fully take in the illustrations. On a positive note though the illustrations were well done and colorful, looking back I could actually get more out of the illustrations then the actual words.I personally wouldn't recommend this book if you're looking for an easy to read kids book -VT Freebie Girl",I wouldn't recommend,1384128000,1,1

"Timelapse only got up to two stars because I think the author does a pretty good job of creating his alternative world. However, his main character, Alex, was totally unbelievable. As opposed to another reviewer who like him and was rooting for him, I was praying for him to be shot dead. I forced myself to finish the book so that I wouldn't write a bad review in case it had a great ending.Alex is supposed to be a fairly intelligent assistant professor at a university. Now I can understand when the transformation first occcurs how one might be in shock and possibly do some stupid things. But his stupidity never ended. He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own. On and on - he was shocked when anything was different from his world. No one, and especially not a well educated history professor, is that stupid, over and over and over again.

"I've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years, but had never really considered subscribing to it. For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.","Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",1330732800,6,6
"When I downloaded this book I had no idea it was a prequel, I wasn't impressed with the short story, but if this is the prequel I am down right disappointed.  A prequel is meant to draw you in and make you feel like you will lose a good friend if you don't read the actual book.  This felt like a story I had read before sans the excitement.

"This is a sweet romantic novella, but I really have to wonder if it was written for the young adult market...or perhaps tweens. It's sort of ""Little House on the Prairie"" with some modern issues tucked in (but not examined in depth.)Katie, the  protagonist is described as ""young"" by everyone, including her ""beau,"" but her age is never given.  Is she 13? 15? 17?  And she never seems to do anything.  Life was hard on the Prairie.  Certainly she would have had chores, yet she always seems able to make time to go and goof off in town or read and sleep. She seems past school age (since her father tells Katie to volunteer to take over for the teacher when she leaves.)Stover Steele (heavens what a name!) describes himself as ""old"" but is he ""20? 30"" 50?Since Katie and Stover do little more than kiss, and even when she's threatened, Stover comes through and rescues her, there's really no need to keep this away from the age group that would read ""Anne of Green Gables.""  And, yet, the writing seems to indicate that the book is intended for an adult audience, who may be a little impatient with the lack of deeper emotion (or, really, any emotional depth) or the lack of details (such as the characters' ages and pasts.)",Who was this written for?,1375488000,2,2

The Witch Queen's Secret is a stand alone book but is part of the Twilight of Avalon series.  This short book is between the first and second book in the series.  While I have not read either the first or second book this was an interesting book  The following is my review of the book.  this is my opinion and not a paid review.  To form your own opinion please support the author and purchase your own copy of the book.This short book can be read in under an hour.  but that does not take away from the book.  It has Isolde who was once Queen as a secondary character but the main story is about Dera.Dera was once an army harlot.  At one time Isolde helped Dera when she was pregnant with a girl child.  Isolde does not hold this again Dera like most women of that time would.  This story is about Dera helping Isolde and returning the favor of the help she received int he past.While a lot of the story did not make sense to me because I had not read the first book in the series it was easy to get pass that.If the reader is planning on starting this series I recommend reading the first book in the series to help understand this book.The bunnies and I give this book 3 Carrots.,Very short,1329004800,0,0

"The Same Moon follows the story of Pearl through her childhood and early adulthood in China to her first several years in the UK where she pursues her dream of higher studies. The first half of the book provides a fascinating glimpse into the day-to-day reality of a young person growing up in China, and her perceptions and observations of a country in transition from strict communism to a relatively more open society. The traditional culture is also brought to life through Pearl's narrative. When given the opportunity to study a Masters and then a PhD in the UK, Pearl jumps at the opportunity, at great personal sacrifice. As she struggles to adapt to a very different culture and to stay in school, she gradually discovers new freedoms she never knew could exist.China of the `70s and `80s was as different from the UK as any two countries can be, and this is very clear from Pearl's experience. There seems to be some parallels between the lives of Pearl and the author, and this provides great authenticity to the story. I often felt like I was reading someone's diary, as the writing style is personal and sometimes almost unstructured, the way a diary is, one thought leading to another. A few things are needed for this novel to get 4 stars: better editing; smoother transitions between scenes and sections; less jumping between different times and places that are described in the same section (sometimes the author skips a bit too suddenly from one thought to another). I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed `Wild Swans' or is interested in China or the experiences of an immigrant to the UK.",Fascinating insights into China,1316563200,1,1

"I liked this story a lot!  Right from the beginning, the excitement begins with a glimpse of the ending.  But it is not a spoiler.  Christina is the daughter of Lt Col Patrick Matthews who is a test pilot for Boeing.  He had wanted to be an astronaut, but did not qualify.  Chris loses her mother at 12 yrs of age, and through her next 10 years or so, struggles with the deep loss.  Her father has also become distant to her, thus she became very independent early in life.  She was a tomboy: tough, confident, and one who's motto is, ""Never give in, never give up.""  At a young age she had a solitary goal that she has set for her future.  Finished with high school, Chris and her two very close girl friends form a close bond through the early college years.  Chris decides to take flying lessons and her flight instructor feels she has a natural talent.  The three girls face many challenges, and Chris seems to be the most logical and confident of the girls.  She confronts every conflict they are faced with and becomes a hero.  This story is simply written, easy to read, and may be more suited for older teenagers, but I absolutely loved it.  Perhaps because it sparked my memories of flying years ago in a Beechcraft Bonanza where I experienced many adventures.  I think this story may encourage many young people to set such high goals.

First let me say that this book was listed in the Christion fiction section but contains graphic cursing and sexual situations.There were far too many characters in the book that did not contribute to the meat of the story and left me confused as to why they were there in the first plce.  I had to go back into the story a few times to jog my memory.  I don't like doing that.  I like to read stories that weave the characters in to it without taking away from the story and confusing the reader. The plot was a good one but it floundered because there was too much going on and not enough backstory to support them.Also there were characters that could have benefitted from a little more fleshing out.  The main character gave us flashbacks of what happened to her but not enough to make sense of her situation.To me it was okay but I wouldn't read it again.  It's very light and has a happy ending.,Strange Reading,1367452800,5,5

I'm the father of two female teens so I've got quite a bit of experience with them.  She may have been accurately portrayed but she wasn't sympathetically portrayed and as a result I could not care less what happened to her.",blech,1251676800,3,3

(Location 89)The narrator of ""This is Not a Love Story"" by Lydia Peelle is a woman whose daughter has gone off to college and she is looking back on her youth because of some old photos that her daughter found while packing.When she was twenty-two, our narrator left Connecticut and went to a small town in Georgia to start what she thought would be a lifelong career as a photographer.  She saw the South as ""raw and dangerous and full of relics of a long-gone era."" (Loc 34) Despite her lack of creativity, what the South offered would more than make up for anything she might lack.  As many often do, she wished later on that she had listened to family's and friend's advice.  Finding Tommy, twice her age, was great fun in the beginning.  Tommy lived on a boat on the lake and didn't work, had parties all the time and drank a lot.  And the nights in Valdosta looking for Tommy in the bars started to get to her.  The title of the story is right.This is a very well-written short story and is the first of this author's writing that I have read.  There is an anthology with more of Peelle's short stories in it which I would like to read.  What happens in the story is believable and realistic and the characters are well-thought out and seem authentic.Highly recommended.",A Connecticut girl in Georgia,1341964800,2,2
"In South of Salem paranormal investigator Allegra Fairweather is hard at work to solve another mystery, but It's so much harder when the clients are your family.South of Salem was a very fast paced read, and I enjoyed the story line. But I found myself having to go back and reread paragraphs due to the way one scene would (not flow) go into the next. The only other complaint I had was Allegra herself. Allegra's jealousy over her sister was so childish. It was mentioned so many times that it made me annoyed with Allegra, and question her character.What I absolutely loved was the character development of the villain, Demelza. Demelza was given a rich back story, with an identical twin and unrequited love. By the end of the book you were cheering on all efforts in killing her, and the evil schemes set forth to destroy Allegra's family.Overall I enjoyed this book, and will read the next one.Happy Reading,Rebecca[...]",Salem Review,1306713600,2,2

"I liked the story line, to a point. I dislike when I read that book that has as many errors as this one had. While the 99 cent price was a really great deal, I feel an author should put a perfect product out there, not one filled with grammatical and spelling errors...they really distract me when I'm reading. Overall, though, I would recommend this book, although the ending was a bit flat. At one point, the heroine spent two days alone, yet started thinking about what happened with her two friends the night before. She also resumed painting, something she had put aside for a long period of time, and created (in her sleep) a portrait of one of the ghosts haunting the area. However, when the malevolent spirit came and caused major destruction in the cabin she was renting, not once did she mention what became of the painting...nor did she ever mention it again, or any of the other paintings she created while there. I thought the painting of the ghost, in particular, deserved a bit more attention than that. I loved the fact that her love interest had visible scars, though...not all heroes are perfect and it was great that Rachel could see beyond outer beauty.",Good...but not great,1327536000,2,2

"From the moment he met him, Gregory knew Ryland was his mate, but when they met Ryland was much to young to claim. Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn he may lose him.  To Gregory, Ryland has always been special, but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him.Ryland didn't understand all of the ramifications of being a tri-omega, all he knew was that he loved Gregory and wanted nothing more than to have Gregory claim him.  Being claimed by Gregory was everything Ryland dreamed it to be, but his dream may come to an end when he and Gregory discover that their happily ever after depends on someone they never met.Forbidden Desires was a good follow up book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.  I loved Ryland from the previous book and adored him even more in Forbidden Desires.  I wasn't crazy about some of the secondary characters but Ryland, Gregory and Viktor, the man who completed their relationship, made Forbidden Desires a very enjoyable read.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Forbidden Desires,1258243200,2,2

To me, that just defies the workings of the natural mind.Forgiveness is one thing but practically condoning the (brave) actions of the Japanese guards and their superiors was a bit insulting.Can you imagine someone stating how brave the Nazis were when they led their victims to the crematoriums?I found this book to be a difficult read at best.",A Book of Contradiction,1398643200,6,6

"A bit of a peep show opens the story and introduces both Leyla and Mason. The attraction between the two of them is immediately evident and powerful. Leyla and Mason are a very combustible combination. However, it is the depth of emotion and caring they have for each other that really shows their characters. Leyla's struggle with her attraction to Mason shows just how much she cares about him by not wanting to damage his friendship with her brother. Mason understands Leyla's position but cares enough for her to risk that friendship so they can be together.Their close ties prior to their romantic relationship create the conflict they must overcome in the story. Having it set around the Valentine's Day holiday adds an interesting twist with the types of expectations it can carry with it.

"Sometimes I download Kindle books from my computer without bothering to turn on the Whispernet because the battery charge lasts longer with it off. So the other day I was going through my Kindle archives to see if there were any books there I needed to upload to my home page. I love the title of this book because it sounds so intriguing, and thought it must have been one I missed. After uploading it I noticed it opened near the end of the book--that was my first clue that not all was well. But I went to the beginning and started reading. The opening is so much like scenes of one of the Alien movies, the one with the marines, that I found it irritating and quickly read to try to find where the plot began. After awhile I started to recognize a few of the characters and realized I had tried to read this book before and gave up. That is why it opened near the end--I had skipped to the end before to see if the story was worth reading. AND IT ISN'T! No wonder I had forgotten the book--it has nothing memorable about it. Macho space marines-Aliens, space settlers on a mining colony revolting against the owners-Total Recall, endless dry discussion of futuristic military equipment-any Tom Clancy book, but add No Plot and it is just words.

Living through a bad marriage and struggling to come to terms with his sexuality was only the least of his problems. Meeting Jeremy was the first good thing to happen to him in a long while. Could Jeremy be enough to help David believe in himslef and want to live life again?Hidden Hands is a sweet story of two broken hearted men from two of Shayla Kersten's previous books who were brought together by chance.  I loved Jeremy in A Helping Hand and wanted so badly for him to find love. For it to be with David from Hidden Force was an added bonus.  David's story prior to meeting Jeremy was a rough one and I loved how being with Jeremy helped him to want to find happiness in life. Their relationship moved fast, but I think because I already knew the characters, the quick pace didn't seem out of place.I wasn't very crazy with the mystery of who was trying to hurt David. I think the pace in which that plot unfolded was way too quick.  Other than that I really enjoyed this story and look forward to much more from Shayla Kersten.

Most of the characters were beyond unlikeable, but were downright repellent, but that wasn't what I found such a turn off. The worst bit, I cannot repeat here or even hint at what it was, it was so repugnant and nauseating.I don't read only cozy mysteries -- when in the right mood, for example, I also can enjoy Jonathan Kellerman, whose books often deal with uncomfortable and dark subject matter -- but this book was, for me, off the charts in terms of how disturbing it was.

I found the book a little slow and I had difficulty liking the characters which is a necessity for me to read a book.  The more I read the more I liked of James writing although this one was a little more of a nail biter than I care for. The plot was pretty involved and at times Ijust wanted the book to be over!.

"This was my first tread into Jules Verne. I was rewarded with a good read. The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make. However, it was still interesting to learn such things from the way to build many things from raw resources to how to create makeshift items to help with survival.The story begins with 5 prisoners; an engineer, a sailor, a reporter, a servant, and a young man along with a very bright dog; traveling in a hot air balloon to escape imprisonment during the Civil War. They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties. There is adventure, camaraderie, pirates, survival, and many other things all wrapped up in this amazing classic.",A great tale of friendship and surviving,1267920000,2,2

I do not believe that the police or Feds or whoever is going to let a noisy stubborn amateur hone in on their investigations and actively participate.  These agencies have their own people who can do research and come to conclusions.  The author was an attorney and I know a lot of attorney work is research so maybe the author knows something I don't.  But this story made the cops look stupid.  Detectives do their own timelines and make conclusions.  I do not think they needed the main character to do it for them.  Having said that I read on and enjoyed the characters and the humor.  It was better than an hour TV cop show.  I can't decide if I will read the next one or not.","Not bad, not great!",1373241600,0,0

"There are many things to like about Woodstock Forty Years Later. The author raises interesting questions about roads not taken, midlife crises, fidelity, forgiveness, and second chances. Unfortunately, he leaves too many questions unanswered, including two of the main plot points in the novel.Another shortcoming involved the author's research on the actual 40th Anniversary concert at Bethel in the Woods. He portrays it as a three day event with only a small sampling of the original bands. The event was actually a one day, six hour show that featured only acts that performed at the original show.A rewrite of the last 50 pages (and removal of the Epilogue)could easily bring this novel up to a 4.5 star rating in my book.

"This has all the elements there to be a great story.  An original storyline, interesting characters, fantastical environments, and a few surprises.  The bad news?  It all happens so quickly, you almost don't care that it happened.  There is no suspense built, there is no getting to know the characters, there is no developing the storyline.  Yes, I understand it is a novella, but there was WAY too much going on for this story to have been taken on as a novella.  It failed.  This would have made a GREAT book if she would have taken the time to build her world, make us care about the characters and give them actual reasons for doing the things they are doing.The book jumps erratically from one scene to another, and flies through the action without giving us any real feeling to the actions.  Someone DIED and it was glossed over, a whole place EXPLODED and nothing was really told about it - other than she wanted out...YIKES.  Could have been a great scene, but wasn't worth more than skimming over when it was all said and done.I would give it three stars for the ideas and the environments.

"This is a ""day-by-day"" account of a young US officer's experiences in the Vietnam war. The author does see a lot of combat but the majority of this is of the faceless, distant, bombardment variety; almost no close-up combat takes place here. Hey, the guy is writing his actual memoirs and this is what took place. However, the impersonal nature of the author's own warfare experience,  together with the ""diary-style"" delivery of the writing made the reading experience a little on the dry side for me. Mr. Evans is clearly an excellent soldier, before he is an author. Have to say I am neither, so I stress that this is a personal observation and I do not want to be judgemental.I believe if you are seriously interested in the Vietnam war and would like to know more of the Vietnam veterans' daily lives and hardships, then this book might well be for you.

A stranger comes to the door, asks to see the mother and after putting his hand over her, heals her and the daughter who's born healthy instead of dead.  And that's just the first chapter.  Who is the stranger?  What is the rumor of the ancient soul that was stolen from the spring of souls?Enter a world of magic like no other.

"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for doing a review.  Unfortunately, the review will not be very glowing.  This is a hunt for ancient treasures - the granite key being a stone with etchings that is supposed to unlock the mysteries to finding some major artifacts having to do with the truth about the early civilizations of the world before the ""warlords"" took over and rewrote history.  Odd - but OK - hunting for artifacts is a plot device that has often been used.  Traveling around the world and discussing some of these archeological sites can be interesting.The plot line is OK.  It has the potential for more interest than it actually generates.  There is the early murder, which adds the mystery, and then the two forces both looking for the mystery of the key.  One side is the Arkana, having existed for centuries and hiding artifacts that prove their theory of the ""true"" beginnings of civilization.  The other side is a religious cult, deeply secretive, with a leader of questionable moral integrity.  I had to stretch my believability a little for both sides, but this is a work of fiction, after all.  And, we do need the good and the evil.The characters were the weakest link.  Some of them have potential, but none seem to develop beyond the one-sided.  Maybe more will happen in the rest of series.  One can only hope.  Cassie, the main character, is particularly irritating.  I had to keep telling myself she was just being ""funny"" when she said some of the dumbest things I have ever read.  And she is supposed to have the powers that will allow the Arkana to prevail?  Give me a break.  Almost all of the characters were more like caricatures than real, but at least some of them were likable.

As a side note, I will say that it was interesting that the cruise ship provided gluten free options for meals.  That was especially helpful for Aggie.",one interesting cruise,1364515200,0,0
"First I'll give some props to the group of writers who probably worked tirelessly to bring this book to fruition. Any reader can totally tell that a bunch of effort was put into it, but unfortunately as a book I didn't find it fully engaging. For this writer, the blog format just doesn't work. The emotional effects of reading action real-time is the same like in a movie. You become entranced in what is happening as you don't know if someone is going to get ambushed by zombies or whatnot. But in a blog format you know that the character is sitting there writing so he's good to go in that respect. I guess the point is that there is a stark difference between talking about events using the past tense and talking about them using the present tense. It is just not that exciting.This book was actually very long. It took me a good number of weeks to get through the whole thing. I was casually reading off and on but it still was long. That's a very good thing; you get your money's worth via your Kindle. You got to know some primary characters pretty well by the time you get to the end of the book so the empathy thing is there but yeah the action and story did not blow my socks off.I have a few complaints but these all are personal ones. Others may find my points irrelevant but that's OK. First off the characters use a blog, cell phones, and laptops to update their life after the fall of civilization. A lot of their reasoning is that the smart people at Google found a way to essentially hack into the whole of the Internet to keep billions of computers and servers up and functioning. Umm no. Even if they did have some excellent hackers there is still no way you can keep up such a vast network remotely. Too many things are dependent on having people on-site IT-wise even if they had a fully virtualized system. I'm mainly referring to the local ISPs and their network. The second thing is the cellular network and power. Same rules apply here as well. To keep electricity flowing and to keep the cell network up it takes too many resources that again, need to be real people doing the work. I'm sure that if you could control a robot body that then it could be possible but we are currently nowhere near that level of technology.So yeah those were my complaints. There were other small things that annoyed me but for the most part it was a good read and worth the money. I just find the main framework of the characters' communication and power network flawed because it just wouldn't happen that way.",Ok zombie read,1310515200,4,4
"I have to admit that after the first chapter and a half I thought I wouldn't like this story at all. Tam is a slave in a world where people are taught that slaves have no soul. Master Lucan is a mage whom Tam desires more than anything else. The mage doesn't treat Tam with a special regard, he is not gentle or caring, there's nothing of that. Tam is a tool he uses for his pleasure and to perform the material tasks a slave must perform. Nothing romantic.It was difficult to accept Tam's devotion for this ruthless being, so I had to change my expectations. I focused on the beautiful and evocative writing and on the dark world building. I also understood that I couldn't judge Tam's feeling from an ordinary point of view, but that I had to accept Tam's feelings and needs. His relationship with Lucan is not balanced, it's not a two-way relationship were there's something given and something taken, but Tam finds a way to be fulfilled, he sets his eyes and his needs and his heart on Lucan and pursues the man in the only way he can: by servicing him.Even if he is at the bottom of that society, Tam is attached to life and he takes his decisions knowing very well the dangers and punishments he will face. He doesn't shy away from them, on the contrary, he is brave and courageous. At the end, that bit of recklessness, that molecule of freedom he snatches away, earn him what he craves for.When compared to him, the tall, dark and dangerous mage seems a bit dumb. So at the end what I have to say is: Go Tam!","Great world building, no romance",1318636800,0,0

"Detective Chandra Hunt's best friend Valerie has been missing for months.  A strange tip leads her to an adult club called Foreplay, where she first encounters the charismatic vampire, Sin-Bad Stoner.  Chandra falls for Sin-Bad's badness, bait, hook, line and sinker.  When she arrives at his home and meets his equally stunning brothers, the rest of Sin's plan explodes into full affect.Sin-Bad has been searching for someone like Chandra for centuries after losing the woman he loved.  Chandra is strong-willed and independent, challenging him at every turn.  After sharing one passionate night where all their carnal desires are fulfilled, it is all the confirmation that he needs.  But first, she must be willing to yield everything to him, including her freedom.Night of Sin blazed off the pages until I just knew I was going blind from the heat glare.  There is no getting around the graphically sexual language, descriptions, and encounters between Mega-Alpha Sin and his obsession, Chandra.  This is a tale of sheer dominance that is mental, emotional and physical on the most primal level.Sin-Bad is so ruthlessly domineering that he sometimes scared me, very much like an adrenaline shot.  Ms. Lee's writing was quite effective in projecting what it means to have a Dom on this level seize complete control of his woman.  Chandra fought but she never stood a chance from the word go.That's not to say there's no substance here, au contraire.  The dialogue between Sin-Bad and Chandra is movie quality, and carries the weight of some interesting psychological truths about the relationship dynamic between men and women, vampires and humans.I'm shying away from revealing a few interesting plot twists, which makes it worth the read.  Night of Sin rocked my world, set my retinas afire, and made me wonder just what it would be like to be in Chandra's place for a night or far, far longer.Patrice F.Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Night of Sin,1272758400,2,2

"The title's joke drew me in to this guide, which varies wildly in tone. There are some gems here: you will never think of THE WIZARD OF OZ the same way again once you've read Jonathan Maberry's treatise on three-act structure, and Elizabeth Massie teaches a valuable lesson regarding contracts. On the other hand, some advice clearly needs to be taken with a grain of salt. (Editor Scott Nicholson feels that mealtime scenes should occur offstage, and likens them to depictions of characters' bathroom functions. Really? I wonder what everyone from the late, great MFK Fisher to Gabrielle Hamilton would say to that.) Some of the essays betray their blog-post origins too much; the conversational tone can seem too informal when instructing readers about grammar and structure. (I cringed every time I saw advice written in all-caps.) I agree with the reviewers who tell readers to choose specific essays to read as needed; the transitions are occasionally abrupt if you read the book straight through. (Considering the number of writers involved, this is probably understandable.) I'm already a fan of several of these authors (especially MJ Rose, who has written excellent publishing guides of her own), and the essays have piqued my curiosity about the likes of Nicholson and Maberry.

"This is a super fast sci-fi thriller, containing only 31 pages. I read it in a few hours...it would take less without kids. lolEugene gets pulled into a black op from the future, forcing him to be a very quick study - he wasn't even supposed to be aware but the constant flashbacks he suffers from prevents the science from working properly.Add to this finding out his daughter is part of a terrorist group, his world is thrown upside down in a matter of minutes.

"London - 1867Dylan Blake has spent twelve long years in dedicated service to the Crown.  He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.  I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him.  This is a wonderful tale and I highly recommend both THE WAGER and THE AMERICAN HEIRESS - trust me, you'll want to read all about Dylan's brother Michael's trials and tribulations with a very improper American woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",captivating historical!,1201478400,6,6
"I really didn't expect to like this story so much since it is for a younger reader than myself. I wanted to read it due to the title, Off The Grid. It seemed like a strange situation for these kids to get into. Living off the grid myself, I thought the book would be more about living that way, than a bunch of underage kids on an adventure. Well, what can I say? The story got me caught up in it and I kept reading. It was a fun read and I enjoyed it very much.This is a story of a family who had recently lost their father and had to move from their home to their grandfather's ranch that their mother had inherited. They sold everything and packed up the car and headed to Promise, Oregon with just enough money to get there. Along the way things happen and they get separated from their mother and are on their own. With the fear of being picked up by the police and put in a foster home without any parents, they manage to get to Oregon on their own.The characters were believable, and once they got to their grandfather's farm, the story really took off for me. I liked the sense of humor the girl telling the story has and the fact that she played a guitar and had an addiction to candy.

A fine edit would have gotten most if not all of the careless mistakes.That being said, the story was a fast read. Great for a lazy afternoon reading in the backyard, but not much more. The characters are very flat, and the mystery the author tries to weave around the main protagonist's purpose of the book was more of a withholding of facts that felt more like plot holes than careful planning for future books. Without giving anything away regarding the ending, I will say that it simply ended. The climax was not so much climatic as it was expected, and left the reader wanting. Again, though, something that could probably be remedied with another round of edits and some tweaking on the prose above and beyond the spelling.","Entertaining, but needs editing",1302998400,5,5

"LEGACY OF THE WITCH (The Portal Series0.5) by Maggie ShayneLEGACY OF THE WITCH is the prequel novella to the new PORTAL series by Maggie Shayne. Released September 1, 2012 Legacy of the Witch introduces the backstory to 3 witch sisters born in the Middle East over 3,500 years earlier and their re-birth into a modern time.In the 1970-80s Amarrah was a young 13 year old girl from Iraq who was fascinated by the stories told by her aging grandmother. Since the time she was 5, Amarrah has listened to the tales about three beautiful sisters- Indira, Lilia and Magdalena-and their love for a young slave girl with the same name as Amarrah. And these stories were all too familiar, as though she had lived the life alongside the young girl. On her death bed, Amarrah's grandmother would admit that the tales were not false, but the memories from a long line of women who have protected a sacred object that at some time in the future would be returned to its' rightful owner and Amarrah would vow to keep the object safe. But it was during the first Gulf War that Amarrah was sent to live with relatives in America and the object was confiscated by airport security. It would be 10 years before Amarrah would ever see the object again.Throughout the years, Amarrah would continue to dream about a slave girl who had fallen in love with a young Iraqi soldier named Harmon, but the dreams seemed all too familiar. The dreams became more life-like when one of the three witch sisters was rumored to be involved with a man outside of her relationship, and the sisters were suspected of being witches, and the young slave girl would be told a story of a sacred object that would one day hold the key to the witches return.Today's Amarrah would find the object on a television broadcast of antiquities and oddities. Tracking down the owner would bring Amarrah face to face with a former US soldier who had been stationed in Iraq during the war. But there is a familiarity between Harrison and Amarrah that cannot be denied, and it is with the familiarity that the past will meet the future, and the lives of the three witches will be put into the hands of another for safekeeping.LEGACY OF THE WITCH is a short story that introduces the premise behind Maggie Shayne's new PORTAL series.  The story is told through a series of dream sequences, visions and first hand experience from 3500 years ago to the late 1990's.  An interesting storyline that could only come from the mind of Maggie Shayne.see all of my reviews at :  thereadingcafe.com",Interesting premise,1348444800,0,0
"I liked the story line. That being said...the author states at the beginning of the book that he thanks those who helped with re-writes and someone named Chene for editing. Editing? Hmmm. Need to get a new editor. Had that claim not been there, I would have given more slack. For instance, the use of 'to conger' when it should have been 'to conjure' or 'dear hunt' for 'deer hunt' and many more. As for other readers complaining about the female characters being portrayed as weak, etc...well...that is the author's right to describe his characters the way he wants. And those that had complaints about the hill people and their language-it's not an unheard of way of portraying people who have survived disasters. An episode of Star Trek (the original series) had characters butchering the language, and believe it or not, there are hill people alive today that speak in a very similar way, so no complaints there.The switching back and forth between the future and the past or rather present (however you wish to term it) is not hard to follow and actually had me curious as to how it would be resolved.If the author cleans the typos up, and fixes the incorrect tense of some verbs, and cleans up the pronouns I can easily see it as a 4-5 star book, but for now, it's two stars.

"Below you will see my review for the old Kindle app which I rated one star.  I am now upping it to three stars.  I canceled the paper with the old app because it was too incomplete.  This version has more of what is in the paper.  Sadly you can no longer buy a single addition proving yet again that the Times does not have much respect for the consumer, but I will subscribe to this when I am away from the paper version and cancel when I am in an area with access to the real paper.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have had the Kindle version of the paper for a year or so and have enjoyed having it on the road.  However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.  I finally had to give it up since it really is inadequate and woefully overpriced at nearly double other papers.  I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

"Barok's Exodus is the second book in William L.K.'s Stritonly Chronicles. Six years have passed since the events of The Eye of the Storm. Buildings destroyed in the storm have been repaired. Prisoners have been processed. Mystical powers have been banned. But the humans still live in cruel prosperity while acidel slaves suffer abject poverty.A mystical theme runs through the book in the form of a curious pinprick, slowly growing, slowly approaching the time and place of annihilation. The mysterious Konig of The Eye of the Storm has disappeared, and faith begins to fail--was he ever really there? So Barok sets out, perhaps to find his god, perhaps in search of freedom, and finds much more than he was looking for.Transformation, of peoples or societies, may not always be a good thing, nor always accomplished without pain. But transformation comes to those who least expect it, and the mystical threat may yet become all too real.William L.K. fills his world and an imagined future history with a wealth of complex details. I'm probably not the best reviewer of his tales, my imagination being too tied to practical science and historical faith, and my tastes to characterization rather than complexity of explanation. Survivors of The Eye of the Storm have developed in interesting directions, and new characters introduce new plot-lines, threats and promises. And the story builds to a climax that begs another book. Is the world of Stritonly doomed? Are all worlds doomed? Book three perhaps will tell.Disclosure: I received an ecopy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.",Complex future history informing epic plot,1297814400,2,2

"I've read Readers Digest for years and love it. Thought getting it on my Kindle would be great.Not so much! Compare the Kindle version as plain white rice to a full course meal. Wasn't hardly anything I liked about it. I think the table of contents should be laid out differently. Didn't like it at all. Listed the main component and you had to click and click to find what you want to read. Would have been much better to show the main catagory then physically print the subtitles underneath it as links. That way you could actually quickly ""see"" the article you'd like to read.  I thought the content was poor at best. Seemed like there wasn't much to the ""magazine"". Short articles and not very interestng articles. Loss of the picture content and short anedotes between the stories left me feeling very disappointed. I think Readers Digest needs to do much better. Especially since there are a lot of magazines going out of business due to the evolution of the internet and applications such as ereaders. The only think I did like about the e-version  was the absence of those pesky ads. I'm glad I only bought the single current issue. Come on RD....you can do much better!",Ugh!,1290988800,11,11

"For me, this book falls into the category of a mild amusement.  It was worth the purchase price and provided a diversion, but it didn't grab me by the throat and pull me in to the storyline.The plot itself was interesting, not something that has been done over and over in other novels.  One of the better things that the author accomplished was seamlessly pulling in history to support his plot.  I think this was a high point of the novel.Proofreading was good with only one typo noted.On the other hand, characterization was so-so.  I got a little tired of the sarcastic bravado several of the characters exhibited, especially at times when the sarcastic attempts at humor were extremely out-of-place.For someone who obviously knows the Oceanside, California area, I was surprised at how poorly the Marines were represented from a realism standpoint, from too-young lieutenant colonels to how Marines were being involuntarily discharged in order to be assigned to the CIA.  I also noted simple mistakes in geography and times throughout the book (shifting the POV from Italy to California didn't seem to take into account the time difference.)I would recommend this book based on the plot alone.  It may not be at the top of my reading list, but it was still a good effort and worth the read.",A Nice Read,1356998400,3,3

So she and her children are in danger but she wants to go sing in a night club... because it's important to her... because she's finding herself.... because clearly she's a complete, utter moron. So I stopped reading at that point. The heroine is TSTL and the hero is not far behind her. I like a suspenseful book as well as the next gal, but come on! it should make some damn sense.

This was a pretty good book with a unique story line and intriguing characters.  The book was suppose to be funny and at times it was pretty funny.  Other times it just fell flat for me.  This was a 'fun' book though.  And appropriate for different ages.My biggest problem with this book was that I felt like I was missing something most of the time.  Like chunks of it had been edited out.  Other then that I felt like I enjoyed it okay but I didn't love it.  I didn't feel any overwhelming need to fly through the book but I did want to know how everything turned out.I loved the friendship between the two girls and the relationship Crystal had with her mother was very interesting.

"I read the Divine Series years ago and loved it! Divine Beginnings has been sitting on my e-read for over a year, honestly I totally forgot it was a novella. This novella is the prequel to the Cast's Partholon series and it explains how the war started. I really enjoyed  Aine and Tegan's story! I know this is a novella but I was sad that it was over so quick, I wanted to know more about their lives together!If you have read anything else by P.C. Cast, you know how good she is at making a very vivid world. I was once again transported to the magical Kingdom of Partholon. Even though it time it wasn't nearly as vivacious as in the series, I had no problem seeing the world Tegan and Aine loved so much that they were willing to risk their relationship to save it.I had almost forgotten that this was series was where I remember The Goddess from. Just like in the House of Night series, The Goddess is such a power being in Partholon. I love how she manifest herself when she is most needed and how Aine puts her full trust in her and follows that down a path that is completely against everything she has come to know.I might have to go back and read The Partholon series again!

"Review by Lori: I picked this book to read because of it's cover. I know I know, never judge a book by it's cover, but the cover really grabbed my attention and pulled me in. So, even though this is a short read, it's really packed with a punch. Caitlyn and Sean are married, she wants to divorce him, he doesn't want his marriage to end. Sean is a cop who's got some bad guy after him and possibly anyone else close to him, so Sean needs to protect his wife much to her chagrin. Sean likes being in control and Caitlyn feels as if he doesn't listen to her which has caused some friction in their marriage. I liked this book. I really liked the idea of the story and the cover kind of hinted at some of the chemistry between the two characters and you shant be dissapointed!! What I had a problem with was because it was a short story, not all of the ideas that the author had could be developed fully. I would have liked to have witnessed the fight that led to their breakup. I wanted to see what their lives were like after she left. I liked the characters, they both were flawed and they loved each other in spite of them. I liked that they hurt each other and their marriage was messy but in the end they loved each other. A happy ending isn't bad either!!!",Short read packed with a punch!,1321315200,5,5

"I picked up this book free during an Amazon giveaway. Collection of a few homestyle main and side dishes, sent to the publisher by readers of their earlier cookbooks.There is nothing here especially original, but the recipes rely on ingredients most kids will like: pasta, tomato sauce, ground beef, potatoes. Some of the recipes include ingredients for which I saw no purpose, such as the baking powder in the dry coating for Oven-Fried Chicken. Other recipes don't seem to have been thought through, such as Judy's Pizza Rolls which I would expect to come out too soggy to hold. Nor is there any interest in healthy cooking, as the recipes rely on high-sodium commercial products such as spaghetti sauce and cream of mushroom soup. There is a big chunk of white space between each ingredient in the ingredient list, which is wasteful and somewhat confusing. (The directions section is double-spaced.) There is no table of contents, so you'll need to bookmark the recipes you want to find again. If you get the chance to pick it up free, as I did, it's worth looking through.

"Optometrist Adrian Giordano isn't looking for a mate.  He's quite content with his life exactly as it is - a successful business, friends and occasionally even dating.  His best friends have both succumbed to their instincts and mated but Adrian shudders at the thought of being accountable to a mate.  At least that's what he thought before meeting Sheri.  Now he can't imagine his life without her.  All he has to do is convince her that he's the only man for her.Sheridan Montgomery has recently joined the Pride.  She's been resistant to joining the pack because of her ex's obsessive behavior and she didn't want to drag anyone else into her mess but she's running out of options.  Instinctively Sheri knows that Adrian is her mate but she's determined to deny it as long as Parker remains a threat.The Pride welcomes Sheri with open arms - and after hearing her story a network of protection is put in force.  Sheri's thrilled with her new friends, home and part time job working at Wallflowers.  Her only real worry is how long it will be before Parker makes a move.  She's successfully ignored her Puma's need for Adrian and continues to deny it to herself and everyone around her.  It's the only way she can protect him - or so she thinks.  Fortunately, Adrian isn't willing to wait for her to come to her senses and he practically kidnaps her and carries her off to his home where he claims her properly.Just when it seems that Sheri could have a real life free of worry over Parker's next move he strikes.  All Sheri's desires to protect Adrian fall by the wayside as it's determined that he is the Pride Marshall.  It's his duty to protect the Alpha and the Pride from threats and he takes his duty very seriously.  No psycho wolf in men's clothing is going to harm his mate or anyone in his pack and live to tell about it.  Of course like any feline he'll have to torment his prey a little before going in for the kill.CAT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR is the third story in Dana Marie Bell's HALLE PUMAS series.  I've thoroughly enjoyed all the stories in this series but this one really stands out.  The characters are larger than life, ballsy, lovable and flawed and because of that they seem very real.  If I wasn't in love with the PRIDE before I certainly am now!  Sheri's caring and generous nature makes her a genuinely likeable character but when you add her disabilities into the equation then she's truly an inspiration.  Adrian's simply delightful and perfect for Sheri because he is so protective and he isn't swayed by her arguments.In addition to the normal cast of characters we've come to know and love in the HALLE PUMAS series we're introduced to another character in particular, Richard, the new Alpha of the Wolf Pack in the Poconos.  There's a showdown between him and Belinda, a Pride member who's having difficulties finding acceptance in the Pride.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

After wasting away for months on my Kindle, I finally opened it standing in line for Bitterblue at BEA this year, and the wait time flew by.Did I mention that I couldn't put Silent Blade down? Later at the MoMA, I cut into my visit in order to finish it. Meli and Celino's turbulent past and unknown future are just that impossible to ignore. Fans of antagonism to attraction romances will feel at home here. Best of all, Meli's myriad reasons for wanting Celino to die by the fire of a thousand suns are completely warranted. There is no easy resolution for reconciliation, let alone for these two to become a couple. Nevertheless, there are some seriously hot moments for Meli and Celino, and for those who are familiar with Ilona Andrews, Silent Blade is more along the lines of The Edge novels than the Kate Daniels series romance-wise, which is at times more spelled out than I'd like. As always, the space colonized world is both effortless to grasp and rich in every detail. I loved the vivid, touchable, and atmospheric setting of New Delphi. I have not forgotten the conjured images of colorful flowers, heady scents, and earthy architecture.  I understand why the leap in time at the resolution was necessary to the plot but in a shorter format, it felt abrupt. (Perhaps I just wanted more?) I appreciated the hard-earned ending for Meli and Celino though, and look forward to reading more Kinsmen novellas. If you're an Ilona Andrews fan and you haven't read Silent Blade yet, what are you waiting for? It is a must-read.",Book Harbinger: Andrews delivers,1347148800,0,0

"I was thrilled to receive a complimentary copy of both Tara Maya's books The Unfinished Song: Initiate and The Unfinished Song: Taboo when I chose to review Taboo.And it's a very good thing I received both rather than just Taboo or I would have been lost from the beginning.THE GOODI loved the premise of the story: tribes set against each other, a young man trying to overcome being exiled while securing peace, a young woman devastated at losing her dream who chooses to break a taboo rather than dance herself to death in a fairy ring.While Initiate was rather slow, with an abrupt ending, Taboo was a page turner. Before I knew it, the compelling characters drew me in until I simply had to find out what would happen to them. If Tara was attempting to imitate the fairies' irresistible invitations, then she accomplished her goal.THE BADAlthough Taboo doesn't have a lot of back story info dump, which makes transitioning from the first book in the series to the second book very easy, had I not read Initiate first I think I would have been hard pressed to understand what was happening in Taboo.Also, as with Initiate, Taboo has a very abrupt ending.Imagine Star Wars: A New Hope ending with the Death Star blowing up -- no Darth Vader in his ship careening away, no big medal of honor ceremony. That is, more or less, how both Initiate and Taboo end.The fact that both Initiate and Taboo have such abrupt endings, and that Taboo has very little back story included, makes me think this series was actually written as a single book, then chopped into segments.THE OVERALLI enjoyed both books, though I don't know if I'll continue reading the series. (I hate feeling sucked into a never-ending story.) I would, however, highly recommend The Unfinished Song: Initiate and The Unfinished Song: Taboo to anyone who doesn't mind downloading the next book immediately to find out what happens next.",Good read if...,1310688000,10,10

"This was a very out-of-ordinary, intriguing tale...simply brilliant! This is truly a suspenseful, adventurous, and most definitely, an uncharacteristic romance novel between Selena and Dan in a sub-genre of science fiction that involves the end of civilization as we know it today. Due to some catastrophic impact, survival for Selena is the elusive lifestyle...until she meets Dan. Because there are no longer any social norms with those that have survived the apocalyptic aftermath, she literally runs and hides every day to survive. It starts with Selena running from a band of thugs (men...go figure). After 4 years from losing her father, Selena is on her own and alone to survive; and did I mention, she is absolutely gorgeous. So, she must be extremely careful in her quest to survive. While she escapes the ruffians, her hiding place is the same hiding place Dan has staked claim; and thus, the adventure begins.Selena is defensive, uncooperative and feisty with her first encounter with Dan; so much so, he has to literally bind her. All he wants to do is help her and bring her to a much better civilized environment he shares with others that have survived. As the tale goes on, there is so much dynamic chemistry and anticipation between Dan and Selena that you just want to explode, and you feel the fireworks throughout!  Dan is an alpha-male, extremely disciplined leader similar to a Black Ops, Navy Seal military type: he was trained by his now deceased special ops dad; and thus has the skills to protect and kill if need arises. Selena, being on her own so long, has much desired skills of her own, amongst being an expert sling-shot shooter; this will come in handy when a battle arises amongst Dan's people and their nemeses.There is quite a bit of action and suspense that will keep you hanging on until you reach the end. It's very intense, exciting, passionate and just downright everything rapped into one tale. I love the intensity of the romance.  They don't get there right away, but you just feel the emotions and the love--it's penetrating, powerful, deep, passionate and breathtaking. I have never read anything so beguiling (and I read a lot). The author, Maia Underwood, should be on the best sellers list because this is one serious, beautifully-written story.

"Jodie B. Cooper's Beloved Life-Mate: Song of the Sidhi, starts with a lengthy glossary creating a fully-imagined world and background to the author's Sidhi series. This short story is complete in itself, taking place in a time long after the war that left strange creatures trapped in ""second dimensional"" valleys about the earth. Portals separate this mysterious world from our own, and elves and vampires, plus other assorted creatures, live almost-human lives under the rule of their own Chi'Kehra.The author has created an intriguing background to her mythical creatures, with synth crystal secreted in their veins, bestowing immortality. The protagonist is almost a regular teen, only just coming into her powers. And the fact that she's a half (or third)-breed--two-thirds vampire and one-third elf (an interesting concept to my mathematical mind)--doesn't help. Finding herself dangerously close to a pure-bred enemy, she tries to run but is swiftly abducted. Soon she's thinking that wonderfully penned first line that opens the story: ""If my LifeMate--supposedly the perfect guy of my dreams--wasn't trying to kill me, I'd be much happier.""The dialog's clever. The characters are intriguing. And the background is very well-designed. Occasional oddities (like heredity in thirds) are somewhat distracting, but this is an enjoyable lunch-time read with a pleasing mix of modern life and mythical sensibility. It should make a good introduction to the author's longer works set in the same world.Disclosure: I responded to a blog request offering a free copy of this book.",Very fine world-building and a promising start to a new series,1320451200,2,2

"Aenas Mays wakes up to news that Hip Hop has been banned and is subject to punishment equivalent to the selling of drugs.  Stunned and in disbelief, he calls his son, Naashon, and they converse on this matter.  Aenas is a young black man that has changed his lifestyle to ensure his presence in his son's life and defies statistics as he attends college.  The day spirals out of control as the adage, driving while black becomes ludicrous as people watch living while black is dangerou , lethal and deadly.  African Americans find themselves encaged like animals if not murdered for no reason other than their lives are considered nothing.Ricky Teems II has spun a very disturbing tale filled with outrageous, ridiculous, and downright disrespectful scenarios.  This novel challenges your perception of present day race relationships versus prejudices endured in the past.  I found it to be unrealistic with just a bit too much of truth riddled with each unfolding scene.  It spurs anger, disgust, bitterness, and revelation to what some may not recognize but more of us do recognize as reality to a certain degree.  We've come so far yet we have so much further to go...and it matters not what people think of us but what we think of ourselves.  I truly believe he was trying to portray a painful picture of how much we take for granted, how African Americans are our very own worst enemies, how the other races relish the thoughts that they are and will always be better than AA...truth or fiction...that is indeed the question.

She discovers that she is pregnant and thinking everything will be okay she tells her lover, only to be tossed out in the middle of the night on her own!  He never even made sure she was okay.

I wasn't sure if I would like it because of the way Alessandro had treated Scarlett, but his reasons were explained well.  There were a few problems that I did have with the story but I felt that he was redeemable.  I didn't like the way he blackmailed her in to marrying him when he had denied the child was his for 4 years and even told her again that he didn't want the child - mind you the child was in the other room sleeping when he said this. Then of course he tells her no more children as though her desires don't matter.  Why couldn't he have compromised as there are other ways to have kids?  If Alessandro was so sure he couldn't reproduce then I'm guessing he didn't use protection - okay well obviously he didn't because she got pregnant - the guy got around a LOT!!

"There are so many issues with this book that a list is the easiest way to point them out.  Spoiler alert for anyone that hasn't bought it, but I highly recommend you don't.The main character simply makes no sense.  A warrior priest that is also married with a family shoots his way through most nights fighting Vampires.  His family is killed in front of him, his church burned down and he is shot many times, left for dead.  Within a week, he is back on his feet, showing no emotion at the death of those he loved and flirting with a beautiful ""good"" vampire.  His dialogue is stilted and flat, moralizing and constantly shouting.  Innocents get killed all around him and he shows not the least bit of emotional response.Every other character shows similar lack of emotion.  A cop's partner is shot in the head right next to him, and the man is at work the next day, casually mentioning the funeral is a few days away.  The reader is never told the reason for the Bishop or his secretary's actions.The action makes no sense.  Casinos catering to rich, powerful people are guarded by less than 12 people, easily dispatched by the protagonist.  The arch-villian vampire's den is just as easily penetrated with few security measures.  The protagonist takes an M4 round in the chest from less than 20 feet and his bullet proof vest shrugs it off, allowing him to continue to fight with no effect (this is impossible, by the way).  When our hero is wounded through his unprotected arm, he cheerfully goes about the next 4 hours or so with little effect.  This is Hollywood at it's worst, an early Stallone movie where the bad guys expend millions of rounds while the hero fights on, picking them off with a gunshot wound to the shoulder that doesn't seem to bleed.There was potential here for character development, but the author never pursues any.  Why does the beautiful ""good"" vampire act as she does?  Are there others like her?  When does she feed?  Where did she get her weapons training?  When did Bill the protagonist warrior priest get his considerable weapons training?I understand this is the first book of a series and I usually give some leeway for a starter, hoping the other books would fill in the blanks.  However, the flaws I've pointed out are just the beginning of a much larger list.  I won't be picking up the other books, nor can I recommend this one.  By the end, I just didn't care about any of the characters nor was I satisfied about the too-predictable ending.  ""Punisher"" comic books are better written.",Terrible,1320796800,1,1

"I am never sure if a series of short stories work particularly as the author of this series is selling the other short stories for the same price as other authors charge for full length works. Also I do not know where this fits in the series (beginning, end or middle).I was initially put off by the implausibility of someone with no experience being put in charge of a space shuttle crammed with well off people, the reason given being to save money. The writing was straightforward and not a difficult read but apart from the twist at the end which I did not see coming there was little of interest in the story. Perhaps if all of the short stories were combined into a full length novel it would have worked better.",Not sure if this works,1313366400,3,3

"Of course, having read ""Surfacing"" would have been even better, but this review urges you, compels you to do just that.Its message has been heard before, told by Thoreau, Emerson, Greek philosophers and Indian American shamans: there is more than meet the eye, and only communing with Nature will bring us back to our true nature. Silence speaks volumes to the eager soul ready to change its human life. Strength is found in every day details proving us what we are made of.The quest of ""Surfacing"" happens in the wilderness of Canada and its ruthless cold, it could have happened on an island, in the desert, anywhere removed from shopping malls, Starbucks and civilization.

"I read this as I enjoyed the first one of these in which the hero's elder brother finds his match. In that one St John, the hero here, was the bad guy, a dissolute gambler and a poor brother. Now he is reformed and back from the war but battling demons and a junkie. Esme is desperately trying to escape her abusie father and marriage to an old and rather sinister man. She throws herself at St John to escape. The plot follows their romance. I found this well written but it failed to make magic for me. Perhaps this was partly because St John was not so likeable in the first book which I read quite recently and therefore could not make the switch to like him. Perhaps it was Esme who just kept throwing herself at him and despite several attempts to get close which failed, still did not really appear to be looking at alternatives seriously to escape what awaited her where she to return home. I cannot say this is bad, the 3 rating is based solely on my gut reaction and the lack of chemistry I felt.

"Some have criticized it as being similar to ""Chasing Winter"" also by this author but although both books have a theme of changing body size, this book deals with it quite differently.  At first Riley is growing larger as the affect of the flu-shot, and is the center of attention around the office.  Nick Carlyle, increasingly feeling like a shrimp at six feet tall begins to fear for his job and reluctantly takes the new flu-shot too.  I felt so sorry for him as instead of growing he became smaller, over the course of a weekend and continued to shrink.  It was the worst Monday of his life when he had to return to work, an even shorter boss amid his new taller employees.  (I was enthralled with the story at this point...)  But here events unfold and there is a huge surprising turn of events which I totally enjoyed and don't want to give away.

"I've had Parallax by Jon Merz on my Kindle for several weeks. Finally, I found some reading time, and what a treat this mob hitman novel was. I'll admit right now that I'm not a big fan of hitman novels, but the character of hitman Frank Jolino was so finely drawn that I was hooked within the first few pages.I'd love to see Jolino in other books because he was intelligent, articulate, droll, and at ease in his own skin. He also surprised me because he had a moral compass. Add all that to the fact that he was a vintage mystery reader, and you get a guy who is complex, appealing, and likable. Oh, yeah, he kills people for a living, but they're by no means innocents undeserving of being whacked, but Merz lets the reader draw that conclusion. He doesn't state the obvious and then hammer it home.Less likable is Ernst Stahl, once an idealist radical and now a jaded assassin, despite constant reminders from Stahl's character that he was completing a job only to save his son. His moral compass is stuck on ""anything goes in the name of paternal love.""When the two end up in some odd paranormal mutual awareness of each other, it's interesting albeit rather unbelievable, but the compelling character of Frank Jolino keeps the reader turning the pages. You probably won't suspend disbelief, but you'll be compelled to keep reading. You'll also be rooting for Frank to figure a way out of the mess and to, somehow, end up with the babe who has some surprises of her own.WarningI downloaded the book in February, and there are numerous ""glitches"" in the book. I won't call them typos because, since I publish ebooks, I know that they are conversion errors that occur when punctuation marks in a Word manuscript get changed to weird symbols when the manuscript is converted to different file formats like HTML which Kindle uses for their digital publishing. Don't let this deter you from enjoying the book.I advise you to ignore the Product Description because it's a spoiler of what are meant to be neat plot twists. Just buy the book. Ignore the glitches, and start reading. Frank Jolino will hook you just as he did me.",Hitman Novel Surprises,1333152000,0,0
"Thoroughly interesting and informative, a `Mind Map' is basically a diagram that you create which organises your thoughts on one page. This book takes you through step by step processes to create your own and shows you every day applications for them.Allow me to quote from the first paragraph from the book - ""We live in the information age, which means that our problem is less one of obtaining information and more one of retaining and organising all the quantities of information that we are required to ingest-both during our studies and afterwards.""This is so true of my life. I feel that my brain is so cluttered with so many muddled thoughts that I can't easily access things I need and am left feeling confused and disorganised. Mind Maps is a tool that will enable me to use both sides of my brain rather than one; thus enabling my brain to perform 5-10 times more effectively. Show me a person who doesn't want that in their life! It simplifies complicated information by breaking it down into a diagram that delivers the information in a quick glance `map' rather than long laborious lists which are hard to digest.I can see that it would have great uses for students, writers or anyone giving a presentation. I personally am non academic and live on a homestead farm; for me in everyday life I can see several uses for planning my garden and renovation projects and to solve problems that crop up therein. I can also see it would be beneficial to estimate a timescale to these events. At the moment I seem to have list upon list of countless tasks that now seem insurmountable. I plan to sit down with a large sheet of paper and create my own Mind Map this very evening.The book also includes access to free software. One is web-based, so with a quick click of a link, I was able to start using it right away. The other options are nice as well, though you have to download and install them on your computer. Since they are all free, they pay for the book several times over.Many thanks for such a helpful read!",Really helpful for everyday life.,1366848000,3,3

It was difficult to read and in some places I felt like the author was trying too hard to use words they might have discovered in a dictionary.

I was confused by the fact that one woman had to drive the car - he parked at all the stops he made, so why did she have to drive?  The contraption they used was interesting, but made me wonder if there is such a device for folks that like sexual pain or was this the author's imagination at work?  Hummm...don't know.

"First of all, I must reiterate the warning that this is a title from Samhain Pub., which means that it is very sexually explicit! So you have been forewarned.Beckett de Saxby, his cousin Colin, and Christiana had been friends throughout childhood. But when Beckett returns from war, he is a far different man from the young one that Christiana idolized. Now is hardened and cold, and he often spends his nights with women of loose morals, or drunk. She doesn't understand how he can hear about the bands of marauders hounding the people in the countryside around them, without doing something about it.Christiana had grown to be such a beauty, and he has tried to keep her out of his thoughts, but he was losing the fight. He promotes her up in the household, making the other maids furious. After she is attacked, he takes care of her personally, and warns of serious consequences if something happens again. He thinks it only lust in the beginning, but she has always loved him.When Beckett's prospective bride arrives with mother and brother in tow, things get interesting. Christiana is heartbroken, but gamely continues on. When she is kidnapped, a knight in black armor rescues her; thankful for his timely interruption, she kisses the black knight on the cheek.Can he be jealous of himself? After the kiss, Beckett pulls away from Christiana, thinking that she might have given the black knight something else if he had asked for it.Watch as Beckett falls passionately in love with Christiana, the servant. The ending is one not to be missed! Highly recommended.","Hot, Hot, Hot!  Need I say more?",1313193600,3,3

Well I felt that I had to let her know that I am one very happy customer and once I bought this series I went on to purchase all of the Brotherhood of the Blood (Vampire Tales) books along with the Tales of the Ware.. which I also love. I rarely write reviews, but I just have to ask what book or books those other people were reading because it sure wasn't this one. Happy writing Ms. D Arc I already have the next two books in the Dragon Knight series on pre-order and keep checking your website for updates on when the next Tales of the Ware are coming out -Thank you !",Awsome start to a great series,1371513600,3,3

"The Pirate Prince is the last book of the Lords of Var series that center around five brothers.  Prince Jarek has always felt his place was in the stars so he spends his life traveling around the galaxies learn about different cultures and worlds and sends the information home to his family so they can stay informed.  When one of his crew members is kidnapped he goes to the planet Lintian in search of him but he finds Princess Zhang Mei instead.  Mei has always had an adventurous spirit. She listens to the wind and fate to make decisions and when she sees Jarek running from palace guards, she attempts to stop him but ends up being kidnapped instead.Mei and Jarek are a lot of fun. There is a lot of build-up introducing Mei, her planet, and some of her family but it helps give the reader a basis to build on. She is very strong willed and stood up to Jarek well even at the beginning of their relationship. Jarek was great. From almost the moment he meets Mei he knows how he feels about her and doesn't second guess himself like all his brothers have done.  There is a great scene with Evan (he has been in a few of the past books as a member of Sam and then Jarek's crew) who is a little psychic and can sometimes read minds, and Jarek where he basically tells him not to make a mess of his courtship like all his brothers have for his sake. He really is amusing.This book was a delightful conclusion the Var series as well as being a set up for two other series featuring Jarek's crew and Mei's siblings.  I look forward to reading them as well. The worlds that Pillow has created with these series set in space is very intriguing and each new book makes me wish space travel existed as she has written it.reviewed by Meganbook provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest review",The Pirate Prince,1346630400,1,1

"Poor editing, poor characterization, and a cliched story line made this a struggle to finish. The manipulative ending just deducted another star. Josie McMaster is one of those beautiful women who doesn't know she's beautiful but everyone around her tells her so, which means, we the readers must believe it. Despite her refusal to participate, she winds up winning a bridesmaid lottery where she'll become the bridesmaid for a wealthy society woman. As an added bonus, the groom's brother is movie star Jake Hall, who's just announced he's looking for a girl to settle down with. Littered with such cliched characters as the spoiled, bitchy model; the gay best friend; and the down home farm girl who talks too much, as well as poor punctuation, repetitive words, and misspellings, this story seriously required some guidance from an editor. Guidance that was obviously never given. This may have been the author's first attempt at writing a romance.

"Question: How does an extraterrestrial civilization survive the impending destruction of its home planet?Answer: Embed your species' DNA in meteors and send them flying throughout the galaxy in hopes that eventually one of the meteors will impact on a planet that is suitable for regeneration of the species.That's the scenario for Robert Williams' first rate science fiction novel ""Peculiar, MO."" The story reminded me a bit of a cross between ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but in fact it's neither. In ""Andromeda Strain,"" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In ""Peculiar, MO,"" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version. There weren't enough mistakes to affect my enjoyment of the book, but the author should have proofread his final manuscript more closely.No spoilers here, but after reading ""Peculiar, MO,"" I don't know if I'll ever turn my back on a cat again!The bottom line: This is a first rate page-turner for science fiction and techno-thriller fans. It's certainly one of the most original and intelligently written alien invasion stories I've read.",Invasion of the Plasmids!,1260403200,15,15

"Buyers should be aware that this book was written while the Ed Sullivan Show was still on the air (i.e before June, 1971.)  It is NOT a study of the show or the man from a modern-day perspective. I assume it was converted to digital format to take advantage of the hype surrounding the 50th anniversary of the Beatles appearance on this show. The conversion was sloppily done and some sections appear to have been transposed or omitted entirely.  It was written by an employee of Ed Sullivan who had a job to protect and must be judged as such.That said, it's an interesting read and worth the small price tag.  Nostalgic baby boomers who remember the performers will enjoy the insider stories.  The story of Sullivan's childhood and early years as a reporter are of interest to anyone who enjoys early 20th century social history.

I could not wait to read his story, but I am sadly disappointed.This is advertised as a novella, but I don't think that is a proper term for this short story.  It  was chapter one of an awesomely good book.  Then it just ended leaving the reader wanting more.Yes, we discover what happened in the past and we get a kind of HEA.  But that is all.  There is no depth.  No character development.  No true story.I can only hope that Ms. Stone will turn this into a full novel .

"Daisy Densmore crawled back to town with her tail between her legs. She's got a lot to answer for and in a small town where everybody knows everybody's business it's going to be hard to hide if that's what she wants to do. The last thing she needs is advice from Pike Martin, vet and brother to someone Daisy betrayed. The last thing Pike wants is the job of ""Redeeming Daisy"".Ms. Hanson gives us a believable tale with realistic characters in her second novel featuring Hearts Crossing Ranch. Her storyline deals with disgrace to redemption, about owing up to our mistakes and taking our lumps when needed. It's also about not being an island and not being afraid to take a hand that reaches out to your even if it's from someone you don't think is an ally. It's very spiritual without overt preaching and more about forgiveness to ourselves.Her characters were likeable, however I would have liked to had a more in depth knowledge of them. Her hero and heroine were very unlikely candidates for a couple and yet I could feel the pull toward each other that the author gave them. Her romance is full of pitfalls and potholes and when the lightning strikes it strikes fast and furious. Her dialogue could flow a little freer and I would have liked a little more descriptiveness also, but those things did not detract from enjoying the tale.If you're the kind of reader who likes a ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" story, you'll love this one.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews.",Interesting,1294012800,0,0

When Heather stumbles into the pack, instead of being comforted, she is cast aside by her mates who believe she is the reason for the death of their father.

"Kindle edition of this book does not have any images.  I was confused that other reviewers mentioned seeing images. My edition of the book did not have any.  Some instructional books can overcome this by extremely detailed explanations, which paint a good picture without images.  This is not the case with this book.The new Guide to Knitting and Crochet starts with no introduction. The book immediately jumps into ""Siberian cuffs"". It gives one paragraphs of instructions which are detailed enough to complete the project.  However, since there is no introduction, general description or images you are not exactly sure what you will be getting as a final project.Most of the book continue in this vain: the instructions are about 1 paragraph long, only a few projects have titles that are descriptive such as ""A Very elegant bag in French blue silk"". But this title  is as much of the introduction or general idea of what the project is about is that you get. So I did not find it to be a good reference, as typically I have an idea in mind and want to find an explanation of the technique to help me accomplish my goal.

Selena Kitt offers one possible answer in this very short tale of lesbian love.Both wed to older men, Lady Elizabeth Capulet and Lady Catherine Montague find in each other's arms what they lack in their husbands' embraces. Lady Capulet's nurse shares their secret.I wish I could expound on this plot line, but being that the story is about twelve pages, that pretty much sums it up. A Twisted Bard's Tale presents an entertaining snapshot between two well-known (and yet apparently not) Shakespearean characters. Being a Shakespeare fan, I loved the naughtiness this possible plot line presents. However, I was disappointed in the story's length. I would have liked to have seen it woven through the actual Romeo and Juliet plotline and continue perhaps past the young lovers' deaths.

"The excerpt from a review on the front cover of this novel says: ""This is truly a love story"". It is. It is one of the best, if not THE best love story I've ever read. The way the writer describes the couple's feelings; the way they interact; it's all so beautiful. The writer uses colour throughout the novel to describe scenes. She describes everything from the clothes the characters are wearing to the colour of the sky, to the flowers that Rebecca (one of the two main characters) loves so much. In some books I have read, it can become tiresome when an author describes everything -- but not in this book. The writing is so expertly and seemingly effortlessly scripted so that the reader can 'see' what is being described. An amazing talent.Yes, there are a few typos and some editorial issues, odd use of words here and there, but on the whole the prose flowed well.I was hooked on this book which is the story of Eli, a young Jewish lawyer, who falls in love with Rebecca, a German girl, who -- trying to escape the confines of her strict upbringing -- has moved to an apartment in Munich. Eli lives upstairs from Rebecca and falls in love with her. He gradually finds the courage to talk to her. We follow the love affair from the beginning, and by the end of the book I really felt as if I knew these two people.The book is set in Nazi Germany before the Second World War, and the author has done a good job in weaving together the history and the love story, showing how the changes in the country had a direct effect on the couple's relationship and their lives.As Hitler's power takes hold in Germany, Eli and Rebecca have to face up to the prejudice around them and the concerns of their families about their forbidden relationship.'The Day The Flowers Died' is so much more than just a love story. It is a tale very relevant to the world we live in today, showing the destructive effects of prejudice and hatred on innocent people.This book made me cry at the end.","A must read, for everyone.",1327795200,2,2
"This wasnt a bad story. It is pretty well written, although the author went to a lot of trouble fluff out the verbiage, and invent new words unique to the story. This usually doesnt work for me and it didnt here either.My main criticism is that it is a little too derivative for my liking. Accepting that there is very little new to say in this genre, the first few chapters were too Tolkien for me. I would have liked this better if it had been a more character driven story with less emphasis on fleshing out the universe where it takes place. Just my preference.The author acknowledges his influences and Tolkien is right there at the top.One character who I thought was unique and interesting was the Riddler.

"I am a big fan of IR erotica and romances so I've been around the block. The trick with the short IR stories, which this is, is to make it as believable as possible in a short period of time.

"So far I've read the first seven books in this series, and I'm hooked.  I'm ready to start book 8; all I can say is, Ricky Sides, keep writing!I've come to really like most of the characters.  They're consistent from book to book.  The farther I go into the series, the more sci-fi it feels to me, but I like sci-fi, so I'm not complaining.

"First off, let's address the Harry Potter comparisons. Yes, this book is about young people fighting against an evil in a world that contains magic. However, that plot line was around long before Harry Potter. That's not why I only gave this two stars.My problem with the book was the main character's complete lack of initiative or any redeeming traits whatsoever. I assume the main character is supposed to be a scared boy in the book but generally a main character has to have something redeemable about themselves in order to be the central piece in a story. He just drifts through the entire book doing absolutely nothing except being scared and refusing to do anything of value. He wanted to be a Knight at the beginning of the book and then when he gets the chance he just comes across as lazy and largely stupid.In the latter stages of the book (and the preview for the second book), after he's finally learned to summon his power at will, he's too frightened to do anything except sit and ponder about how scared he is. This power is supposed to give him knowledge of whatever he points it at and yet he NEVER does anything with it that would make sense (except for one scene at the end of the first book that sort of felt like the author just making something happen to show the reader how powerful it really could be).Really wish that the main character had at least one redeeming quality because I enjoyed the world and the other characters in the book. Unfortunately I just can't enjoy a series that's completely centered on a character that leaves me constantly questioning why he doesn't DO anything (except point out how scared he is and think about why he doesn't do anything).",Horribly passive main character,1352678400,5,5

"Ian Thomas Healy's ""Graceful Blur"" is a story about a superhero named Mustang Sally who can run so fast that she appears to be a graceful blur. That's ironic, because this story goes by so fast it appears to be... well, more of an ungraceful blur.""Blur"" is set on an earth in which a group of superheroes belong to a team of good guys called Just Cause, apparently somewhat like the Avengers or the Justice League. Salena, aka Mustang Sally, is a member of Just Cause, and her superpower is the ability to run very, very fast. Her goal in the story is to set a new land speed record and break the sound barrier, on foot, at the Bonneville Salt Flats. So she goes out and runs... very, very fast. And that's pretty much the story, which isn't surprising since it's only 11 pages long.Ian Thomas Healy is a good writer (I've read a few of his stories) and this story is competently written. It describes the legendary Salt Flat well and sets up a plausibly good premise in which big name companies sponsor stunts like this in exchange for plenty of commercial recognition. And there's always room for some more good superheroes in the fictional world. However, the story is lacking something very basic to all fiction... dramatic action.That last sentence might seem odd since the story is about a woman running at speeds approaching 800 miles per hour, when a single misstep might result in a disastrous spill (something most comic books and superhero movies never give a second thought). However, Healy fails to convey inject any sort of suspense into the story. In fact, since it only takes Salena about five seconds to run a mile, there's not a whole lot of time for Salena or the readers to think about what she's doing or what might happen if things go wrong. Nor is there time for much of anything else in the story. There's no significant interaction between Salena and anyone else other than the expected good luck wishes she receives. More importantly, there's no emotional identification with Salena, whose motivations, background, and character are not much more than a blur. So, what we're left with is the equivalent of reading a short story about Superman brushing his teeth or Spider-Man drinking a cup of coffee.I haven't read any of the Just Cause books, but I would guess that Salena's character and the characters of the other superheroes who appear as spectators in this story are better developed in those books. It's also quite possible readers of those books will appreciate the story more than I did. However, all I can judge the story on are these 11 pages. In these 11 pages, Healy has taken something that would probably, if it really occurred, be incredibly exciting and reduced it to little more than a training exercise for which Salena has carefully prepared. As a result, readers will likely feel that the story itself has gone by at the speed of sound, because it winds up being over before it really gets started.",The Story Is Just a Blur,1400544000,0,0
"Rachel Vincent's My Soul To Loose is a brief glance into Kaylee's life before she discovers she is a bean sidhe.  During a trip to the mall with her best friend, Emma, she finds herself having what she calls a ""panic attack"".  She has always had these but has never had a full explanation of their cause.  The moment she sees a boy in a wheelchair she feels one of her ""panic attacks"" coming on.  The difference between this panic attack is that this she not only screams uncontrollably but it also lands her in the Mental Ward.  After screaming her lungs out to the point of exhaustion she wakes up strapped to a bed, unable to move, in a small white room.  During her forced ""sentence"" in the Mental Ward she meets a very interesting fellow patient, who herself has a special ability (but no spoilers!).Rachel Vincent's prequel is a wonderful glance and explanation into Kaylee's personal experience with her pre-bean sidhe knowledge.  In the following novels, thoughts of her time in th Mental Ward are brought to the surface more than once.  She constantly struggles with the affect of her bean sidhe gift and how for the longest time she thought she might have actually been crazy.  This in turn has affected her, in more ways than one.  My Sou to Loose also helps answer many questions that come up in the following novels (again no spoilers!). It also shows how strong Kaylee is - not many girls go to the Mental Ward, then learn that they help souls by screaming their lungs out, live for hundreds of years, all in a few months time and then have the mental capability and maturity to accept it and embrace it.As always, Rachel Vincent's ability to write in perfect detail astounds me.  In My Soul To Loose Kaylee visits the Netherworld for the first time, even though she has no idea what it is, let alone has a name for it.  Rachel Vincent's descriptions of this world sends chills up your spine.  Unlike in the following novels, she is very careful to not give away too much of this world - she gives you just enough taste of the gruesomeness and terrifying creatures that inhabit it.For those that have not had the opportunity to read or start the Soul Screamers series I would first say ""WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!"" and then I would recommend that you read at least the first book before reading this prequel.  My Soul to Loose is a perfect addition to this series.",Review by Patricia's Particularity,1307145600,0,0

"I'm not very good at writing reviews. What can I say? I really enjoyed 'The Last Sandman.' I wasn't so sure at the beginning of this book, there was a little confusion over who was narrating the story. However, this confusion was quickly cleared up. The story sucked me right in, and I was disappointed to see it end. The author was great at making his imaginary characters seem believable. I hope there will be a sequel in the near future. Without giving away spoilers, I have to say I'd really like to see Jake and his family's adventures expanded, and I'd also like to see Cole's twins share their own adventures as they enter the land of Nod.

"In 1806 when Mallory Edwards was seventeen and John Barron was a few years older, their parents arranged for their marriage.  They met on their wedding day for the first time; exchanged vows; and the next morning he left joining the army.Seven years later, Mallory is tossed from her home due no payment as her wandering husband's uncle stopped sending her allotment.  Fuming, Mallory comes to London to confront her husband and demand a divorce.  Not caring one iota for proper behavior, she rips his head off in front of his mistress.  When John realizes the screaming crone is his wife, he grabs her and leaves his mistress at home. Mallory proves he owns nothing as his fortune has been embezzled while he dallied.  Together they seek his missing relative who absconded with his money.  However, as they fall in love while hiding as commoners he realizes his wife is an intelligent beauty and no longer the little girl he married; she realizes her husband is an intelligent hunk and no longer the runaway boy she married.Readers will enjoy this 1997 Regency ""Treasure"" as the metamorphosis of the lead couple is deftly handled by Cathy Maxwell.  John is a selfish boor while Mallory lacks self esteem; each matures as he looks inside himself and dislikes what he sees and she begins to gain confidence.

Thus he knew the bridge was there.  Yet ...nothing...just all of a sudden the bridge is an issue and life threatening.  Okay - say we let that go (perhaps the aliens can only rip through time once every so many centuries or what not) .  That is a relatively small suspension of belief issue (given genre) .  The others?  Not so much.  This fellow has a mere 3 hours to save himself (and others according to himself on phone) .  When talking to himself he hears backrround noise of several people.

[One star]The story flows easily and naturally with many funny and sardonic flourishes and touches. Zombie profiling also stands out as an appealing element - at least for most of the time.

It wasn't long, repetitive, drawn out and predictable.  Thank you Lora Leigh. Moving on to the next one.",Surrendering,1358726400,0,0
Overall I really liked this book. It was very steamy and a bit funny as well. I loved the characters and the fact that Chloe and Mark were able to find love despite their misunderstanding and his personal demons. There really is someone for everyone and this book was a testament to that. The only issue I had with this book was it was just too darn short. I wish the author gave me more.,Sweet and HOT but too short,1381363200,0,0
"Errant is part of the author's killer unicorn series. You should not let the fact that Errant is part of a series distract you, this is a standalone story. It does not even take place during the same century as the other two books in the series.The concept of the story is very good, and the descriptions are lovely. The story does have a plot, though once in awhile it gets a little muddled.I can't help wishing that the story was longer. If the author would have made it a novella instead of a short story I suspect that she would have been able to create stronger characters, which I think would have made the story a great deal more interesting.This is great choice for anyone who is looking for a quick and enjoyable read.",Cute little story,1309651200,6,6

"This book is the single worst example of poor editing (what editing?) in my history of reading free Kindle books.  The book is rife with examples.  In fact, you will find them on virtually every single page.  I'll just mention a few.For example, misuse of words.  Using ""feat"" instead of ""feet.""  ""Rouge"" instead of ""rogue"", as in ""He was a rouge Colonel.""  (Which, actually, is quite funny.)  ""Accommodations"" rather than ""commendations.""  And there are a thousand or so more examples, which you will find should you choose to attack this story.Overuse of commas.  Broken sentences.  Lack of quotation marks.  Or, how about changing font sizes and colors (from black to gray and back again).  Poor adjective use:  for example, a boat is described as ""large"" at the beginning of a paragraph and as ""mid-size"" near the end of paragraph.  Use of ""it's"" instead of ""its"" and vice versa. I could go on, but take my word for it.Now for the story:  first of all, it's too long.  Second, here's the plotline (which is full of holes):  go after an item, fend off the bad guys, make it though ancient traps, escape, go after next item.  Over and over and over.  The story is just too long and repetitive.So why two stars rather than one?  As much as I wanted to just quit reading this disaster and delete the book from my Kindle, I toughed it out.  Why?  Because for some unknown reason, I actually liked the Omega characters and wanted to see how they made it though all the obstacles that were thrown at them.  I had no real interest in learning how the book ended...I just wanted to know how the characters fared.  But, given that, would I recommend this book?  Uh, I don't think so.  Let me put it another way...NO!

You don't really get a feel for what his idea of werewolf is until the very end, and it doesn't really fit with the rest of the novel. These werewolves can shift on command, don't change into actual wolves but are more of an 8 foot human-wolf hybrid, and other than being indestructible, are seem like pretty average people.

I thought many times as I was reading that it seemed more like an adult reminiscing about his childhood, and projecting logic and maturity onto the characters that would simply not be possible at their ages.

"Wyoming rancher Quinn McKay's been in love with his wife Libby for the past fourteen years.  They've been married for nine of those years and he couldn't imagine being with anyone else.  That's why their `trial separation' is proving to be the most difficult thing he's ever endured.He hopes that Libby will come to her senses and allow him to return to their home and her bed but it's become apparent to him that something has to change or he will lose her for good.  Quinn isn't one to talk about his feelings or show a lot of affection but after three months of separation he's willing to do whatever he has to in order to save his marriage.Libby McKay has never stopped loving Quinn but all the improvements she's made to herself and their home have gone unnoticed and she's afraid that the love and desire they once shared is gone forever.  She'd hoped that maybe a little time apart would rectify the situation but nothing she's doing seems to be enough to get him to fight for her.  It's a heartbreaking situation but it looks like divorce is imminent.Quinn does something completely unexpected and he reinforces the fact that he's staked his claim and lets her know that he has every intention of seeing that she gives him the second chance he deserves.  He even goes so far as to find new ways to show his feelings for her.  However, one of their biggest problems could simply be their lack of communication but maybe a weekend together could bring them closer than ever - especially if they're completely honest about everything that happened and what they desire from each other.Lorelei James' STRONG, SILENT TYPE really captures all the emotional angst that occurs when a marriage is in trouble.  What I especially enjoyed about this story is the genuine love that is evident in how Quinn and Libby respond to each other.  This is a relationship that deserves a second chance and really touched me because I can personally attest to the impact family interference and heartbreaking loss can have on a family and how much work it takes to keep your marriage from falling apart.  Lorelei James will touch readers' hearts with this memorable story which is not just very emotional - but also downright hot!

"Heather Killough-Walden is a very creative and daring writer. She makes great dialogue, unexpected twists, memorable and lovable characters (even the antagonists), and all her plots are very well written.  I've been following her for years, along with other fans who discovered her in some of the first websites she contributed to.  Like many of them, and those who have found her through recommendations, she has quickly became the top ""favorite"" and to me the main reason why I kept on going back to those websites, waiting for the next installments to her stories which are always in the fantasy or sci-fi realm, although sometimes they were also very sensual.Hell Bent is more action-thriller though, and although it's a romance and has lots of sexual tension, it's more PG13 and will leave most adults disappointed.  However, it's a book that will keep you on the edge and will make you keep on turning the pages. It will also keep you wishing that you had someone like Jack (if you're a woman, and maybe the gays too) although not with all the dark and bad things about him.

"This is a short story about domestic violence brought on by alcoholism,frustration and poverty.  Truvy is the mother of four boys, two older and two are small.  She constantly calls on her friend, Noor, to come get her and the children because Jake was beating her up again and she feared for her life. Noor would drive there and pick up Truvy and her children and take them back to her house, but sometimes Truvy would change her mind and decide she couldn't leave.  Truvy and Noor worked together and Noor could tell that when Truvy wore turtlenecks she was trying to hide the bruises.After so many calls to Noor to rescue Truvy, Noor realized that she could not continue to do this.  She told Truvy that she would help her any way she could, but there would be no more coming in the middle of the night to rescue her and the boys.  Truvy seemed to understand and there was always the story that Jake was shaping up and was sorry and wouldn't hit her again. Noor knew differently.Things get worse before they get better for Truvy.  It's a story of how manipulative and abusive some alcoholics can be, and how enabling family members can be.  It also has something to say about the courts, but I'm not sure how realistic that is.  What happens at the end is alarming once again for Truvy and her children.  Readers will find out exactly what happens.",A case of domestic violence,1317600000,1,1

"Offside Pass is the story of Devon, a hot hockey player who's been relegated to playing in the bottom of the barrel hockey league, and Saul, a sports reporter who knows nothing about sports...Devon and two of his three brothers are hockey players who are constantly brawling on the ice. Devon's twin brother Chad is straight (and married), and their baby brother Trey is also gay. The fourth brother, Brock, is a drug addict who is estranged from the family. We learn he was also a hockey player until he was injured.As the story opens, Devon, Chad, and Trey are headed into the arena of the newest team they've just been traded to. The team is last in the league and the arena looks like it hasn't seen maintenance in years. When they started out, the brothers were hockey superstars, but there was an incident that has caused them to spiral downward to where they are now - their last chance.Saul has just taken a job as a sports reporter for the local newspaper, the only problem is he doesn't know anything about sports! He falls for Devon - hard. Devon is attracted but tries to stay away because Saul is a reporter and he can't risk the family secret getting out. But Saul knows something's not right, does a little investigating, and pieces the story together.Offside Pass was a quick, sweet read. I'm not used to short stories, so the pacing was a bit fast for me, but within the story the romance between Saul and Devon was tender and simmered through most of the story, culminating in a hot, steamy release. I loved that the big hockey player was so affected by Saul. I also liked Devon's brothers, Trey and Chad, and hope Trey's story is next.

"When it comes to speed and convenience, there is no better way to read the Wall Street Journal. With almost no advertisements, you just get the articles and pictures in a very concise and easy to read format. With wireless delivery, you get the paper delivered to your Kindle, no matter where you are, as soon as it comes out.I can't say enough how much I enjoy this version of the Wall Street Journal. With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me, whenever I'm looking for something to read.  Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one.  In the ""Page One"" section of the paper, it has several ""What's News"" blurbs, after the first couple articles.  While this is useful on the print version, it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle.  You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper, with a link to get to them.  Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.  I really wish that they would get rid of these ""article teaser links"", but in the mean time, I'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall, I really love the WSJ on my Kindle.  I highly recommend you get it in this format.  Good luck when you cancel your paper version, though, as they'll keep delivering it to you long after you cancel (so they can keep reporting you as a reader to their advertisers).

"I rated this two and that was generous. I was debating on giving it only one, but it wasn't THAT bad. Overall I really felt that the writing was immature, the characters weren't developed and the world building was none existent. In the fantasy genre, world building is crucial, in my opinion anyway.There was a good premise to the story and I liked the idea of what this book could have been, but the author missed opportunities to delve into the world of the Angels.  Instead she barely scratched surface of the paranormal aspects and focused more on the ""romance""...if that's what you want to call it.  The level of romance in this book is lukewarm at best, so it's safe for younger teen readers.The Angel, Sterling, is very immature. Especially for someone who is supposed to be over 700 years old. Not to mention that he's been helping and mentoring humans for 700 years, so I don't understand how he can be so childish and jealous. That doesn't make sense to me. The female lead, Claire, was full of teenage angst as one would expect of a 17 year old. Throw in a few crazy and obsessed exes on both sides and we have tons of drama. Good drama? Not necessarily.I usually don't like to nitpick a book to death, but there were so many grammatical errors that I had to mention it. So if you're a stickler for that, this book will bother you.On the plus side, I did enjoy some of the conversations that Claire and Sterling had. I found myself chuckling at their banter. I also thought that the secondary characters Ariana and Argento were really good. They both really added to the story and made Sterling a little more acceptable. He is almost like their younger brother. I also can appreciate the fact that Claire's parents and family were around. The family and their thoughts on Claire's relationships were very realistic and I always can appreciate a story that can balance a little realism with fantasy.Overall I thought that this story had great potential. I only wished that the writing was more mature and Sterling and Claire's characters were more flushed out.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, I would have loved to experience more of the world of Angels. That would have added an amazing edge to the story.  An editor would have been a great addition as well.

"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna, and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings, that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone, and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story, because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin, a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart, as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child.

During her down time she decided to join a local acting troop in Tombstone to learn how to flirt with a man.  Sammie had not had much practice in the art of attracting boys due to a strict upbringing by her mother.  Sammie goes into a local shop, Shady Lady's Closet, to find a costume to wear.  After she picks out something, she tries it on and although she likes what she sees, she's a bit embarrassed by how much of her is showing.Jimmy is a counselor who likes to people watch.  He says it helps in his job.  He also enjoys acting with the Tombstone actors and is playing the part of the lonely stud.  And with him it is an act.  He has decided not to get too attached to any young woman until God directs him to ""the one"".  When he sees Sammie, he almost can't believe his eyes.  She's almost too pretty to be real.  Is there something familiar about her?I liked how Jimmy stood by his convictions. Even when it got hard, he stayed true to his faith.  Not that it was always easy! When Sammie and Jimmy get together there is definitely sparks. I got a kick out of how Sammie was trying to be something she definitely was not.

"When I got my new Kindle I was searching around for free amazon.com books to test out my new toy. I wanted some fluff, something to read under a maple tree in the grass on those sunny summer days, and this book looked like it fit the bill. With low expectations I began reading (it is free after all). To my surprise I found that Kemppainen had put some thought into this story. It's fast paced and interesting, a book you don't want to put down because there's never a slow spot. He develops caricatures that I cared about and a world that was a mixture of his suggestions and my assumptions. This is one of those stories where you see the action in your head as you read and wonder afterwards whether Kemppainen told you the building looked like that or if you put it together yourself. He never gets lost in the details but focuses his attention right where it needs to be, giving us just enough rope.Not only is the story fast paced but it is multidimensional. This isn't just the story of one caricature but the interwoven stories of many residing within a world which takes on its own life and feel as we see it through different lenses. Kemppainen also manages to give us some mystery. Throughout the book I knew something was missing, it's just around the corner and I turned each page hoping to find it in the next paragraph. Like any good mystery we aren't just strung along until the last page but given crumbs that lead us to the author's pay off.This is not Isaac Asimov, with his deep and complex worlds which challenge today's social orders. It is a fun and exciting futuristic (but not space shippy) read that walks the narrow line between light reading and good old fashioned fun.

"Sophisticated Stephanie has spent most of her life proving that she is worthy to take over her father's business.  Little did she know that the foundations of her world begin to shake when hunky Quintin storms into her office to insist that she breaks off her relationship with his 17 year old son, Rob. Rob who?!?! The pair then tries to find ways and means to get rid of Rob's fixation on Stephanie. Quintin then slowly begins to realise why Rob is so fixated with Stephanie, but will he be willing to clash with his son over Stephanie's affections?What a pity.  The beginning of the book started off with quite a lot of promise, but unfortunately, the story started to falter and limp its way to a rather bland conclusion. A rather bland read and I was barely able to finish the book (and only did so as I had nothing better to do that day). You really just wanted to smack some sense into all the characters and tell Rob to grow up and stop being a whiny kid.",A bland read,1323907200,1,1

"This is a story with Aggie Underhill, One would described as an Agatha Christie character, an elder Brit woman with her off colour humor and her passion to solved mysteries, introducing Mrs. Aggie Underhill  who can't keep herself from not getting  involved with a mystery where ever she goes and she becomes so entrenched in it she puts herself in to dangerous and witty dilemmas.It opens with a young couple celebrating their first year anniversary of adultery in the scenic hills of California. On a date of a romantic dinner, the female character has to tell her lover a secret not sure how he will respond to it. Her secret did not go well, and now she is suffering the scary consequences.Chapter two opens with the main character, Aggie Underhill she is a widower and has a discipline in her manners, except on a spur of a moment dare from a dear friend she purchases a sports car and enjoys the freedom it give her. She relocated from Britain to be near her daughter and family. She lives in Palm Springs and her close friend of twenty years Betty lives next door.She is reminiscing about her deceased husband and his note and necklace he left behind, leaving her, her own mystery to solve but she is not ready to face the tumult of going through his personal items. Meanwhile she is late for a coffee engagement, not a date with the handsome police officer and is being followed and trying to compete for a parking space with a blue hair lady who looks like Marge Simpson.As the plot continues the mystery girlfriend is back in the story. Mixing in dysfunctional family dynamics and the book club fiasco, this reader wants to thank the author for writing hilarious scenarios; this book will definitely lift one's spirits. And wait there is still the other mystery to solve of the young greedy married man who is cheating on his rich wife and the mysterious girlfriend and the threat of sabotage and murder lurking around every corner. Of course the characters will all crossed paths which give Mrs. Underhill the advantage to unravel the clues of the suspicion events.In the midst the author adds family gatherings and antics which delights the reader for each character has their own colorful personality, especially Mrs. Underhill, entertaining this reader with her brazen confrontations with others.There is karma floating throughout the plot, it is good to see the bad guys get their dues when they commit acts of spite against another, a good hot coffee spilling in the lap, yeah karma.Betty, Aggie's best friend too gets involved not by her own will just being in the Wrong place, at the wrong time, put all the characters together and you have a comedic and suspenseful story in the makings.  The competition between the mature ladies over the handsome police officer is a riot. Reading along and bang an event and this reader's pulse went racing not expecting that twist.The suspects are leaving clues, two dead bodies, was it intentional or accidental, what about a ransacked home, missing jewelry and cherished jewelry all lead to an adventure with so many twists it hard to keep track but entertaining too. So many occurrences and this reader's mind was racing wondering who are the suspects? And what is one's motive to invaded someone boundaries, the question, what were they looking for?In the author's words:""My word,"" Betty said. ""It has Alexander Dominsky's name scribbled on it.""Aggie nodded. ""That's Lionel's handwriting."" ""It doesn't make sense. Why would Lionel have Alexander Dominsky's  name written down? Unless... maybe it's just a fluke.Maybe he liked his books.""""Maybe,"" Aggie muttered. ""But I doubt it. Someone ransacked my home the same day Dominsky was found dead. There's something more going on here.""""I don't know, Aggie."" Betty shook her head. ""I think you might be looking too deep.""""Aggie held up the key dangling from her necklace. ""This means something, Betty. You said so yourself. I say we go over to the Sinclair's. At the book club, Esmerelda Sinclair announced that Alexander Dominsky was staying in her guesthouse and that he was a good friend. What are the odds that she died the same day, too?""As this reader read the plot it turned out to be an intriguing investigator's mystery with the ring of an British Agatha Christine flowing through the pages and continues with excitement and humor all the way to the conclusion with some very strange and complex events; plus there is a hint of conspiracy mixed in too. I highly recommend readers who like little daring middle age ladies who view everything with a Brit's perspective about life, that in itself is entertainment,  If so,  you will enjoy this and the other mysteries in this series written by this author.  Plus there is a You Tube video to give you a glimpse of this talented author's style, just goggle book title and author's name and be amazed. . ..[...][...]","Aggie Underhill, Investigator and Grandma, with witty humour",1343779200,9,9

"I enjoyed this book, and unlike another reviewer, I didn't really find the characterizations thin.  I liked Henry, and I thought his living arrangements had a lot of potential in subsequent books (and boy, would I like his house!).  I also liked the amount of detail that was given. Another reviewer referred to it as 'padding'.  Maybe it is, but I also liked the way it gave the story immediacy - you felt like you were right there, watching the goings-on.  The concept of a retired police chief helping out with current cases is no more or less implausible than most of the premises for most mysteries.  All things considered, most police departments nowadays would jump on the chance to have an expert, unpaid, consultant available!  I thought that the plot was interesting, the victim just 'shady' enough to be realistic.  My big gripe, if it can be called that, was with the ending when the murderer was revealed.  I don't necessarily dislike the author's decision on who should be First Murderer, but I didn't like the way he presented it - it was too sudden, too abrupt, and the clues leading to their identity were a bit too subtle and got lost in the shuffle, so to speak. If the author had eased Henry into his realization of who the murderer was more gradually and provided one more clue that pointed to that person, I think the ending would've been immeasureably improved.  All in all, this was a pleasant, easy read with a bit of a twist at the end.  I'd recommend it.Note on Kindle formatting:  Good.  There were a couple of issues, but nothing to distract from the reading experience.",Quite good,1293667200,25,25

"This wasn't a bad read but it was flat and under developed. There wasn't a strong conflict which made you anxious to turn the page. The premise of the book was that  Andreas, the H, blackmailed one of his employees, Saskia to pretend to be his fiancee so that his grandfather would not pressure him to marry his older cousin whom he really hated. Typical Harlequin plot which can still work if develop but the blackmailed centred around his accidental meeting with Saskia who was shamelessly flirting with him because she mistook him for her friend's boyfriend whose loyalty was being put to the test by Saskia and her friend.Andreas used this incident and the threat of losing her job to blackmail her to pretend to be the fiancee. This was to me a weak basis because her supervisor's report showed she was a top employee with a lot to offer the company and there was no basis to fire her. The h was compliant as she did not insist that he hear her side of the story and he and his cousin insulted her with little protest from her.Also, there could have been more interaction between H and h. There was too much narration, ie hearing what was going on in their heads but not much talking to each other. Because of this I couldn't believe that they fell in love and so quickly.I would still recommend this book but can only give it 3 stars.",Could have been better,1399161600,0,0

While there is a p.i. working for the lawyer, his role is very much in the background. The writing is crisp and certainly reads well. Characters are all very nasty and unpleasant which might just be a reflection of the city. So while I give the book 5 stars for the writing, in  actuality I only gave it 3 because this is not my kind of book. I prefer a book where I can enjoy the characters and the atmosphere.

It is about a young girl named Bryn Dawson (Dawson = Titanic to me.

All the girls in the school fall for him but his eyes are for Bryn only.

When you read you will find out why. When William realizes that being with her will only lead to her death, he leaves. Bryn decides to try to commit suicide by walking into the water. She calls it 'being closer to him,' I call it 'suicide.' Whatever. I am a hopeless for romance but when it came to this story it just over did it for me and it was every single line. Every thought was something mushy about them being together forever and dying for one another. There is only so much love I can take and this book just over did it for me. It was very repetitive as well. I get it! You will die for him! No need to mention it twenty-five times. Also, it was very predictable. That is it.

While the opening page and a half of the book is reasonable in terms of grabbing attention - setting up questions in the reader's mind, the following three pages of blatant exposition quickly cools whatever interest was roused for the plight of the two women stuck in the Nevada desert looking for the illegal horse round-up.The book would have benefitted much from an editor's eye being run over the text, followed by a good deal of hard thinking about what to keep in, and what to remove.  The dialogue feels forced and stilted, and in some places kept in merely for the sake of having dialogue, and the recurring instances of exposition - of telling, rather than showing - what is happening do not help to improve the overall impression of the story, of nor the authors skill at telling it.It is a shame, because it could have been such a good book if handled properly.",Not At All What I Hoped It Would Be,1305504000,3,3

Ok the first review with a two star rating had nothing to do with the story so let me tell you why I am giving this book a two star rating. First there isnt enough of a character development for me. Also the usage of sighs and giggls along with the word methinks got annoying. The characters were always sighing for this or sighing for that; it was in every chapter as well as giggling at the wrong moments and methinks were used way too much. Also as that reason sounded a little bit redundant so did some of the story when the characters would explain something they sometimes do it twice but worded it slightly different as if the authors forgot they already had it in the story causing the story to drag. Also the actions of the characters didn't make since to me either.....spoil alert.... the parents of the heroine jump to conclusions and don't believe her when she had been forced upon by her cousins intended calling her a whore.  Also she is seen unchaperoned by multiple people with the hero when they were hiding their relationship where I might add there was no romance development... anyways she was seen and even recognized by the king himself but never becomes ruined even when her father finds out. Instead he beats her in the street for all to see and apologizes later in the story like he isn't a bad guy and she accepts his apology!!!! Oh and when they run off to elope it takes a while for it to happen instead of eloping right away?? There were just way too many issues with this book for me. I don't recommend it.,Methinks...ugh,1355788800,1,1
"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?

The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to ""show"" him.

I loved it.This book has a lot of good stuff in it. The hero is the number one. I am sadly less interested in the heroine just because she sees the hero as a ""bad boy"" when we and she has no support for this idea except for his tats and piercings.

"Well from the cover made up of a photo of a couple of hot dogs, which has been cut and paste onto a basic blank computer art image with the title and authors name typed on, you knew straight away this was self published piece that not a lot of time was put into it and no one else is obviously involved in editing or getting it to Kindle.  But not all self published stories are terrible, there are some brilliant undiscovered authors who have written some great stuff.  At the time of this review this was a free download so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it.I imagine this is written by some kid in a high school English class or something where he gets in trouble or something and the teacher demands what are you going to write about Jeffery.  Oh hot dogs he replies thinking of his lunch or trying to get a laugh. You're going to write a whole story about hot dogs.  Yeah sure am, Jeffrey replied, and set out to prove he could.  Unfortunately he failed.No Free Lunches just doesn't go anywhere, nothing happens, it's just a bunch of scientists annoyed that they have been called to this room, away from their important research on AIDs, Cancer and the like to discuss hot dogs and how to lessen the rate of little kids choking on them.  None of them want to be there but some are enjoying the free lunch provided.  That's it that's the whole story, nothing happens at the conference, no one kills anyone, no one sleeps with anyone else, no one cracks a witty one liner, no one really does anything.Plus there's obviously been no editing, even by the kid's teacher.  We start of describing the scenario and suddenly Shutup for a damn second this was importanter (yes this is the word used) interrupts the setting description as if someone is now talking. ""Just as he was decided that he'd doled out enough gravity and had started to open his mouth to speak"" is an example of a typical sentence in this kid's story.  I think Jefferey would have failed this assignment.  It does only take 5 minutes to read if it's still free and you want to check it out, but there are a lot of better 5 minute read free Kindle reads on Amazon. If it now costs money, definitely give No Free Lunches a miss.",Better Things to Consume 5 Minutes of Your Lunch Break Than This Poorly Written Story About Hot Dog Research,1327276800,4,4

"ANYTHING CAN BE DANGEROUS might very well make some horror novel readers stop reading.  Starting this book out with the story that is - well - a little outrageous, was the most dangerous part of this book.  If you like your horror raw, real and visceral this probably isn't for you.  If you can enjoy horror that is funny, freaky and a little like a B-Movie, grab this book.For me, I like both kinds and all kinds in between.  I like to be scared, shocked, repulsed...or sometimes just made to laugh while all the weirdness happens.Not that this book is a satirical take on horror.  This isn't Scary Movie 5 (or is it 6 now?)  This is a horror writer having fun with a strange idea in the first story.  I liked it, and I had fun right along with him.The story about the couple and child abandoning thier car in a snowstorm was tense and really a very good short horror story.  The zombie finger...pretty good too.  The zombie cafe, a little bit of Twilight Zone mixed with blood and guts.Overall I'd pick up Hults again.  I enjoyed the book, I got what I wanted out of it, and for me that's good enough.  It didn't knock me over or make me dry heave...but I don't need that all the time.  Sometimes I just want a fun book that has an edge and creeps me out or makes me cringe.

"I received this as a birthday gift from my husband and sister, along with a Kindle.  It's a great looking case and fits the Kindle perfectly.  I like that it isn't too big and that it fits inside my not-too-big purse due to the fact that there's no extra space, yet it protects the Kindle very well, just like a glove.  At first I thought that the Kindle with theAmazon Kindle 2 Silicone Skin Case Gel Cover - Clearwas going to be a problem because the silicone skin makes the Kindle ""un-slippery"" so that it has a nice grip.  That also means it doesn't slide against the material in the inside of the case very easily.  But then I realized that the case unzips on two sides so you can place the Kindle with the silicone skin case on into it easily inside.The quality and workmanship of this case is evident.  It's well made with kind of a foam lining.  I wouldn't want to drop the Kindle, I'm not sure it would protect against that, but for normal carrying it around and keeping it from getting scratched it does a great job.

"The following is an excerpt from a full review featured at the strangeamusements blog:Above all things, this debut succeeds at creating a gothic atmosphere that settles upon the reader like the ominous fog of its pages (or screens in the digital era). And while this is true, this does not imply that the horror story that unfolds is something old-fashioned like its environment. In fact, the action is fast-paced and frequent, containing some frenetic kung fu fight scenes and thrilling chase scenes that would stand up with the action level of a John Woo film.Overall, Demon's Night transports you into an old world full of gothic atmosphere and old-style horror. Blending elements of mystery and white-knuckle action with this traditional environment, Guido Henkel arrives with something of his own brand of horror, a brand informed by appreciation and integration of widely divergent influences.

"In the first couple pages of this story, I was thinking that I wouldn't like it.  I then began enjoying it, but by the end I was let down.  The author has created an original story (almost like X-Man meets the Fae world), but the back story feels crammed in and the love story was rushed and unrealistic.The story is set in an institute which studies the paranormal, specifically the Fae world.  The man who founded the Institute is married to a Banshee.  Sounds interesting?  Yes, it does, but don't expect anything more than random scattered details about it.  If the item description contained information about other books or stories in the series, it would be helpful.  All I saw was a teaser for an upcoming novel at the end of this story.

"T.M Roy's book about a truly odd couple (Oregon professor Kent Xavier and blue alien visiting Earth Povre)  is a fun read with romance, adventure and humor.  The couple bond as Kent tries to keep Povre out of the clutches of government agents while hoping that her people manage to rescue her.  The action is deftly split between scenes of on Earth, and aboard the ship that brought Povre to Earth.  The characters are well written and believable with the relationships between them ringing true.  While the story may seem cliche (alien on Earth needs rescuing from the big bad government agency), T.M. makes it fresh and takes it in interesting directions.  She has a nice turn of phrase and writes in an enjoyable style.  The rescue of Povre has a bit of a Deus Ex Machina feel, but that's a slight quibble, as she does set it up better than most.  The ending leaves the work open for a sequel and I'm really hoping one is forthcoming.",Fun odd couple romance,1296345600,3,3

"This was the first book I read by this author, and my first impression was I would not be reading more of his books due the plethora of editing issues.  A few errors and I would just send the author a private note with the corrections I would suggest, but there were just too many to cope with.  Having said that, the story was so intriguing that I had to finish the book.  After finishing this, in spite of my reservations I then read ""Bismarck 2013"", and that was so good I also read ""Children of Salem"".  The two latter books, although not without errors, appear to have undergone a more thorough editing process.I guess when you find a storyteller as talented and as imaginative as Robert Walker, you can slog through a lot of grammatical errors and still enjoy the tale, and I do plan to read more of his books.

"Newly divorced, Gloria Sanders wants to do something about her excess weight. So she goes to a gym, with specific instructions that she have a female trainer. But when the trainer assigned to her is unable to make it, gym co-owner Landon Barnes can't believe his luck. The student teacher he had a crush on all those years ago is in his gym, looking for a trainer, and he plans on being that trainer.There is an instant attraction between Gloria and Landon, despite the six-year age difference. Gloria is hesitant, because of her size and age; but Landon sets out to woo the woman he wants, and he won't take no for an answer.All Worked Up is a romantic tale of that proves love knows no size, age or color difference. I loved Landon, who was determined to prove to Gloria that he loved her. Gloria is a very realistic character that I think any woman over the age of thirty-five will identify with. I loved the way they blended together.There was one little spot that threw me though. Given the romantic flow of the storyline, the hero used a word during a love scene that pulled me out of the story. It took a few minutes for me to recover, but I did. And, even though that bothered me, I couldn't stop thinking about the love the two shared, and how Landon didn't force himself, or the situation. That redeemed him in my eyes.All Worked Up is a story for the romantic soul in a romance reader.AmeliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",All Worked Up,1262736000,2,2

"I really liked this story on as I think in many ways it is a cautionary tale.  If we forget past history like the rise of Nazism in Germany then we are doomed to repeat it.  Our founders understood that too much centralized power in government is dangerous and lends itself to the rise of dictatorships. I liked the story for that reason.  On the other hand what I found disturbing was the authors assumption that terrorism would come from the right wing.  Than kind of bothered me.  I have seen too much malicious political bias coming from the left.  To me, terrorism would more likely come from the extreme left. I see the USA currently controlled by a corrupt left that believes that the end justifies the means.  A philosophy that ignores established constitutional law and does what it wants with impunity.

When a freak rainstorm drives her into the shop of a fortune-teller she thinks that it is just a coincidence that this fortune-teller tells her she will soon meet her soul mate.  She is too clinical to believe in something like that, even if her Nana had told her the same thing before she died.Irishman turned American Reece Kellan is a software designer that is immediately drawn to Destiny after she slams into him, leaving a shop during the rain.

Some of these issues bugged me with this book, but not enough to force me to put it down.The concept is fantastic (I really like the idea) and the opening scene draws you into the story.  With it being a free book, I didn't necessarily expect it to be as polished or edited as a book-industry best-seller and it wasn't.The scene is set for a compelling story to take place.  I won't do spoilers, but the characters the author crafts are interesting and the storyline itself holds great potential.  The problem for me was that the actual storyline is only hinted at, never developed.  Just when you think it is about to get interesting and some questions are going to be answered, the book abruptly ends.The story could be phenomenal if it were fleshed out and the characters developed.

Then when Reeve and her brother joined the army together, she is left on her own.  She ends up studying and learning more about the herbs she loves and takes on witchcraft and healing as a profession.When her brother dies overseas, she is upset but in a way she is more upset by the fact that Reeve has not sought her out at all since he has come back, in fact he seems to be avoiding her.  But she might not be the issue, as she finds out when pursued by a wolf of Samhain.  The wolf is a bit familiar.Now Sara has a dilemma to help Reeve out she accidentally puts a fidelity spell on him.  How will she ever know if he really loves her, when she cures him of his curse, or if it is due to the spell?  What is a girl to do?Red and the Wolf was a wonderful story centered on curses, Samhain (Halloween) and what someone will do for love.  I loved Ms. Anderson's writing and heartfelt characters, as well as the touch of paranormal.  Especially, what you do about a shifter, who does not want to be a shifter.  In Red and the Wolf you are able to see the premise of ""if you love someone enough you will let them go"" with a twist.  And what happens when they don't want to go.

I thought the characters of Runako and Margo were well drawn.

Margo's sassiness really comes across, but her finally getting over her self esteem issues made me cheer.What made this book much better for me is that it takes place in the monsters' home in the mountains, and more than just the three main men in the books, you meet others and get to witness how they live, how they mourn, and even how they love.  Hot and fun, it brought me in better than the second book did, and while the first may remain my favorite, I really want to read Henry's story next and hope the author is working on it right now!","Ice, Ice Baby!",1315440000,0,0

Should the author do an edit to fix these issues, the tale would flow much better instead of bogging down constantly. There is a bit too much telling rather than showing, but on the whole a good effort. I found myself having trouble liking the characters, but then again I have never been partial to female leads - that's just me.I will keep an eye out for future installments, hoping the author works on his craft.",Good story in need of some polishing.,1321488000,3,3
"I could not get into this story. The femal lead just got on my nerves. And in my opinion menage relationships are just a hard sell. Three people - usually two men and one woman are that into each other. I only see it really working if the men are bisexual or brothers. Seems to me ego and testerone would be a big issue. So, if an author doesn't sell me on an emotional connection between the men I can't imagine it working. I didn't get an emotional connection from this trio.",Lacked an emotional connection,1335657600,1,1

"I picked this up as a Kindle freebie.  At first glance, I was a little put off by the poor cover art, but in over all I liked the book.  It was entertaining enough, yet I found myself a little disappointed with the level of action in the book. Overall, there was no where near enough action.  On the other hand, I did like the interaction between Txema and her roommate Tyreen. That was cute, Tyreen was kind of mothering her or acting as the responsible one during all the chaos on campus.I also liked a few of the ""good"" vampire characters. Txema's cousin Chanson seemed to be the only one truly who had her best interest at heart. Several of the male vamps have ridiculous crushes on her.  Kind of odd that so many old men would fall for this 18 year...who happens to be pretty immature in the scheme of things. There is also a very old immortal human, an alchemist, whom also clearly isn't quite right but is trying with all his prowess to hook up with Txema.The protagonist Txema finds herself in them middle of a vampire war and at the end of the book, the ""bad"" vampires storm the castle where she is being hidden.  I was expecting to get a awesome fight scene.  No...what we got was Txema blacking out just as the vampires storm in and then she awakes somewhere else. What a cop out.  That was truely disappointing.  The scenes that took place during most of the book led me to believe that would continue until the end, but it didn't. Honestly, if sort of felt like the author ran out of steam in the last quarter of the book.Unfortunately, this book isn't very memorable.  It was a decent read, but I probably wouldn't read the next book if I had to pay for it. Since in fact, I did pick up the 2nd installment as a freebie, I'm going to continue on and read it.  I hope that the story becomes more intense in the next book.","Decent read, but don't expect too much.",1327190400,1,1
"This sequel toReining In (The Network)picks up about six months after Khalida's traumatic turn of events at the end of book one. Forced into hiding, in fear that Vyktor's men will avenge his death on her and the Network, she disbands it and hides out. When Mack finds her she is forced back into danger in order to protect Vyktor's widow Kori, bringing to light an aspect of Vyktor that Khalida had never considered or been aware of. Someone is trying to kill Vyktors's beloved wife and it has been forecast that Khalida is the only one who can save her. Dawn Judd takes us on a thrilling ride as Khalida tries to determine who the murderous ""phantom"" is, who appears to be not only after Kori, but also Khalida. Why is this phantom so set to destroy them both and will she be able to stop it?I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel, which fleshed out the interpersonal relationships in Khalida's life, and we begin to understand her complicated family interactions.

"I was surprised that I didn't like Oscar Wilde's ""An Ideal Husband"" more.  I had seen the movie (An Ideal Husband [HD]) some years back and really liked it.  This original book version, though, bothered me a bit.  As is usual for the Wilde I've read, the writing is very good.  But, there seems to be a bit too much of politics in it along with having a tad too much meanness in it.  It's odd, since the movie is pretty close to the book.  My guess is that the producers added some mitigating aspects to Mrs. Cheveley (the antagonist) and the actors lightened things up.  As such, I'm rating the book at an OK 3 stars out of 5.  That loss of a star is because of a personal preference, though, not because of anything technically wrong with the book.

"I got this for free for my Kindle. I read through it yesterday. It was a quick read, full of action, angst, lore and lust.The author has created a new vampire-esque mythos. The voice is young and fresh, but the story is not. Part Buffy, part Twilight, part Charmed. As a YA, it is more sexually explicit than I would recommend for my students or daughters, but it is too YA to bridge between YA and general market romance. My impression is that the author was not satisfied with the sexual content in Twilight, but liked the love triangle dynamic and decided to write it her way.The title might make sense for those familiar with the whole series plot line, but I found it misleading - though I may have skimmed the part where that was explained. I will not be reading the rest of the series.Generally I am not moved to leave a review if my impression was dominantly negative, but I downloaded this based on it's high reviews and thought I owed it to other readers to be honest.","Cliche, but a fun, fast read",1316908800,8,8
"I really loved the basic story here, but it felt like the author had never even read a sci fi book before. You should not have made them humans. I liked the idea of amphibious beings, but your just confusing things. Especially when you have your characters doing things underwater that would be impossible in any universe. Seriously, how can you drink tea, and spread jam on bread underwater? Also, your technology for these people was seriously just weird. You have a race who doesn't even know what space is, or what it consists of, sending a manned ship out into it. How could they be that backward on the one hand and advanced on the other? It doesn't make any sense at all. It's like you forgot what you were writing about at times. You contradicted yourself throughout the book. Another thing about that that bothered me was the sudden presence of gravity on board the remora when they lost their water. You do realize they should have been weightless. Did you even research anything about space?I'd also like to point out that according to their speeds, they never came close to leaving their solar system. That is one of the most crowded solar systems I've ever heard about, what with all of the aliens and what not flying around.Your story line was flimsy, totally unbelievable, and had too many fortuitous events. Your characters were completely unbelievable as humans. You should have made them a different species. Humans are not that squeamish. You might want to study some literature on human nature if you do another book for grownups. All in all, it kept my interest just barely. Made me mad enough at the end that I'll never read this author again. Very lazy. It's like you decided to wake up one morning and write about something you've only ever heard described to you, badly.

I couldn't wait to find out the story behind Nick, Vic and Rick. As to the execution, with such an interesting idea I really wish that this could have been a full length book, because with setting the stage, taking a step back to explain Nick's condition and his connection to the heroine, and the finale, there wasn't much space to really build a romance between the pair only to bring them together long enough to change both of their lives.

"I got this back in December when it was on the Kindle freebie list, and finally got around to reading it.For a free book, it wasn't too bad. The plot kept me reading, and the eventual villain was a surprise (this is two books in a row I've been surprised, it's possible I just haven't been reading enough cozies lately).However, I came close to tossing the book several times when the heroine drove me kind of crazy. She meant well I guess, but she had a terminal case of Jessica Fletcher-itis - and never got results. Her ""I'm going to sneak out and make everyone worried about me"" tantrums really frustrated me, and detracted from my enjoyment of the book.Also how fast she and the Hero got together irritated me, but that's a staple of the genre, so it's to be expected.Overall, a solid three star book, especially for something that was free.",Good but not great,1338336000,2,2

"What I didn't understand when I ordered these (and you may be confused about as well) are what we are seeing in the picture in this listing. What you get with this set is a normal in ear headset and an oval rubber carrying case (which is what is shown on the pic). Basically it has slots for the two earbuds to go in and then you wrap the cord inside the case like a yo-yo. It's tidy, but if you use your headset often (as I do) then you'll find yourself constantly unwrapping them. They don't get tangled, which is good, but non-tangle flat cords like the ones that came with some HTC phones is suprior.As far as sound, these are good but not great. Beats audio headphones are far superior and even the headset that came with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone is better sounding. Adequate but not great.So what you get in this set that supposedly justfies the higher price is the way these average quality headphones wrap up in their carrying case.

"This review contains spoilers.Let me say first:Don't let the three star rating fool you, too many people give a full five stars for any book that they can manage to finish without spitting on it.This book isn't going to become one of the greats and there are a few points about it which I thought were poorly handled but it did manage to keep me hooked to the end. Although that was mostly because I was just curious to find out more about Tarke.I had two main issues with this book. One, and the bigger of the two, was the lack of plot. Basically all that happens is Rayne gets kidnapped twice by the Atlantean council so they can use her to get at Tarke by getting his identity from her or while he rushes to save her. She also spends a lot of time learning about Tarke's touchy-feely issues and how ex-slaves are supposed to interact while they visit some of her husband's worlds. (There is a sort of side-story of Tarke's men freeing the remaining crystal ships of their envoys but all the parts of it that would be interesting take place off-screen.)The second issue is that Rayne seems to have some kind of 'Kidnap me' disorder which is prevalent throughout the series. The entire series is basically of her being repeatedly forced to follow others wherever they want to take her, whether by kidnapping her or simply saying ""follow me if you want to fulfill your destiny"".Overall the book wasn't bad.

"If you're looking for a good and quick read during your lunch or smoke break at work, you probably want to give this one a pass: I wish I did.

"When I was 13 and haunting the public library one summer, I discovered Zane Grey western novels. The very first one I read was East of the Pecos, and it thrilled me. It had action and adventure, horses which I loved, and told of an Old West where men were men and women were glad of it. The novels had a strong romance subplot -- at least strong according to my newly-minted teen-hood.That one book had me scouring the section where his books were shelved. I can't remember how many I read. Each thrilled me as much as that first one.When I bought my Kindle a couple of years ago, I spent days scrolling through the lists of free books and low-priced ebooks. Imagine my delight when I came across this little gem -- a collection of 26 of Zane Grey's most popular novels and with a Linked Table of Contents. I grabbed it, and started reading.I have to admit that I was totally surprised that the stories still captivated me. I'd thought I might find them as stale as an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land. Not at all. The stories are still compelling plus I love the American West history in each.After I'd read the first book in this collection, I visited the Texas Ranger Museum in Waco, Texas. Walking through the museum, I realized how accurate were Grey's portrayals of the men who brought law to Texas and to the history of nineteenth century America.This collection is wonderful, and it's worth far more than the modest price. The books are delightful in every way and make one understand why the western was so popular in television and movies for so long.",Classic Westerns Hold Up,1354924800,1,1

"I would give this story 3.5 stars if I could. I quite enjoyed this mystery involving the appearance of dangerous creatures from long ago. The creature and it's mate are discovered due to recent flooding in a small country area near the great Mississippi River. At first many small amimals, and then eventually people go missing. A group of like minded friends join forces to combat the creatures and save the area from further destruction. They also have to overcome government forces who have their own agenda and wish to cover up the creatures existence.The story was presented in a straight forward, easy to read  manner. The style of writing did take a little while to get used to, being told solely from the narrator David's point of view. But, I did enjoy the story and also the comeraderie between the friends.

"I stumbled upon this ebook in a discussion where the author was self promoting his book in a topic that was not really related to this type of book.  Since that tends to irritate me I jumped over and bought the book for 99 cents with all intentions of giving it the critical scalding it deserved since almost all self publish types are badly written, poorly edited and inconsistent IMHO.  Surprisingly I found myself pulled into the story against my will and I am enjoying it at present.  I am about halfway through the first book in the series and the only thing I have found distasteful (ignoring the subject matter for some) is the ""host"", she needs work as a character. I will update this review when I finish and move on to the next book unless it falls apart in the 2nd half, so far I am engrossed and wish I had it in a physical book form since I do not ""do kindle' and reading a book on my PC has obvious drawbacks :)  Hang on for the update and so far the author gets kudos for a appealing idea and so far an entertaining work of fiction.  UPDATE:  Well I finished the book and while it was very entertaining, engrossing to be honest I felt a bit cheated in the sudden ending but since I am about to get the next installment I can't complain too much but obviously there should have been a few more chapters or perhaps book 1.5 should have been part of book 1.  So with all that said I still find myself throughly engrossed and waiting to start book 1.5 to see where the several story lines go.  I can safely say I have paid much more for books I could not even finish reading so we can probably give it another half star for 4.5 Stars.  It is the best 99 cents I have invested in many years and I can highly recommend it for most anyone who likes a good drama in a science fiction setting.  My only concern now is that the author may drag this out too much and I have to start skipping pages but so far its a pleasant addiction.......

"Allie's life was at a standstill before she made the decision to leave town and accept employment with her father's friend Griffin.  While her love for Charlie might have induced her to stay, the knowledge that she'd never travel and see the world if she did so made her decision a simple one.  Throw in Charlie's best friend Alex's confession to Allie that he's also in love with Charlie and the whole situation could get complicated fast and she simply isn't prepared for that sort of drama.Charlie and Alex are best friends and that's not going to change but there are complications.  For one thing Alex is in love with Charlie, but he's also in love with Allie and he readily accepts that they could form a happy trio.  Charlie has no clue that Alex is bi-sexual and he's completely stunned that Alex and Allie seem to share some secret that he isn't privy to - it's a bit daunting but since Allie left town to go on her grand adventure with a much older man (yeah, Charlie's just thrilled about that one!), he has years to prepare for when she returns home and is ready to settle down.Six years later she returns, older, wiser and more prepared to accept the dynamics of the relationship that could be possible if she can convince Charlie and Alex to explore their feelings with her.  All those years of pent of desire and frustration cumulate into a series of intimate moments that leave the men bewildered and uncertain about their future.  For Alex and Allie the relationship between the three of them is sheer bliss but Charlie is struggling with not just the idea of sharing Allie but also his romantic feelings for Alex.  Alex has had years to come to grips with his bi-sexuality but this is all new to Charlie.  Can Allie and Alex convince Charlie that he doesn't have to give up his dream of marriage, a white picket fence, kids and a dog - he just needs to alter it a little bit to include Alex.EVERYTHING NICE by Mari Carr is nothing short of a fun read.  While I'm used to the heroines being shy characters needing to be seduced into being naughty Allie thrives on adventure and her appetite for sexual escapades rivals any mans.  Charlie and Alex are equally fascinating because their ideas about the sort of life they want are so similar yet so different - at least they were until Alex clues Charlie in on his long denied desire to test the boundaries of their affection for each other.  Mari Carr does a brilliant job bringing these characters to life and making the story amusing while still instilling enough conflict that the reader eagerly devours each page waiting to find out what happens with this trio.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",simply a fun and hot read!,1362096000,0,0

"I enjoyed this book for what it was. I liked that it was a Christian novel although the characters beliefs played more of a background position. It was clear that their beliefs did not seem to influence their actions or thought processes outside of routine (bed time prayer and saying grace). I think too much time was wasted on events that didn't have anything to do with the main character and her lingering issues.I had issues with the main character in that she spent too much time with the married couple, and too much time with (too many) single men. Anyone whose ever read any Christian Singles books knows that those are 2 things singles are encouraged not to do. And although she had a likable personality, she was really one demensional. She only had one real main focus (finding a man) and seemingly no interest in anything else. It was almost like she couldn't be a whole person until she got married. Her only passion was to get married and have a family...no plans or passions beyond that.I also thought the flaskbacks were random and didn't add any significant details to the development of the story or the characters. And the ending was a big let down, there was very little insight given about her future husband whom she only talked to on random and emotional occassions throughout the book. Too much time was spent on her male best friend who could have been cut out early on in the book. The male best friend was a driving force throught the story yet there's no mention of him at the end of the book.

"To a certain extent, Zombie Literature has been done to death and beyond, even to the point where it has become fashionable to insert zombies into classic works like Pride and Prejudice.  This book marks a nice departure from standard zombie fare, while retaining enough of the genre to keep that nice post-apocalyptic feel that zombies are so good at providing.  While I like the single-minded focus of your average zombie, I found that the idea of a few smart zombies thrown into the mix added to the sense of peril.  It appears that most of the typos referenced in other reviews have been corrected and I thought that the book was well-written, suspenseful and even funny at times.

Not ever have been a cheerleader myself, the opening line of the book's description pulled me in instantly.In Peachville, even the cheerleaders have a dark side...And here I thought only the cheerleaders of my high school had a dark side.Harper Madison has been tossed from foster home to foster home only to wind up at Shadowford in the small town of Peachville.  Trouble has seemed to have been following her like a shadow since the fire when she was just eight years old.  Shadowford Home is her very last chance.  If she screws this up it's off to juvenile hall for her.Suddenly, one of the local cheerleaders is found murdered and everything begins changing for Harper.  Though the popular, beautiful, cheerleaders ignored her previously, now they seem to be throwing themselves at her wanting to be friends.  They encourage her to try out for cheerleading, and she makes the squad herself.  Everything looks like it's going her way.  She is dating the star quarterback, and she finally feels happy.  But then there's Jackson.  She feel's she knows hims somehow, but can't remember how or why.Pachville it seems has a secret, and Harper is intent to find out what it is.What I loved most about this book was that the reader doesn't find the truth until almost the ending.

"I hate to give a book a low rating based on technological flaws instead of story, but in this case I believe that's the only reasonable way to handle the situation.First, let me say the story would be an enjoyable read were the Kindle edition not rife with technical errors. By the end, I was gritting my teeth and forcing myself to finish because of an attachment to the characters and their plight. That's the good news.Many other reviewers have commented upon the same thing that drove me batty: Missing words, sometimes entire phrases or partial paragraphs, caused frequent reading stumbles. The problem grew worse the further I read, until by the end, every page -- and sometimes every paragraph on every page -- resembled Swiss cheese.Normally, I excuse minor formatting errors in ebooks. Mistakes happen. Often, the publisher (or the author, if the book is self-published) discovers the problem and issues a corrected version as soon as possible. More than two years after its release, the desperately flawed Kindle version remains unfixed, and the glitches are anything but minor. Why? To me, such an oversight indicates, at best, a lack of attention to the market; at worst a callous disrespect for readers.I enjoy Alexis Harrington's work, but my disappointment with the completely fixable flaws in the Kindle edition was so severe I do not foresee investing in her future ebook endeavors.",Desperately flawed Kindle edition,1360972800,0,0

I find explaining where you are should be easy unless, it involves sending someone into the future, into the past and then back again. If not handled correctly it can become a real headache for both writer and reader. I feel that Mr. Erickson handle that tricky task with aplomb. A good read.

"Barrington creates a futuristic world full of heart pounding suspense with ""Crucifying Angel."" Set in Las Vegas in the not so distant future, detectives Payce Halligan and Gavin McAlister must solve a series of bizarre crimes before the murderer strikes again.Barrington moves from thrill to thrill with ease. Her writing is crisp and the pace flows well. She uses a good economy of words to describe her futuristic world, painting a vivid setting for the reader.Both Gavin and Payce are interesting characters, and come to the story with scared backgrounds. Payce accidently shot her last partner during a confrontation and is now finding her emotional scars healing.  Gavin, who is British, had to witness the death of his family. His emotional scars still haunt him. How Payce and Gavin grow and deal with their pain is a joy for the reader to discover. Their courage and dedication are traits to be admired. Ralphie K. Teon as the ""Crucifying Angel"" is the perfect villain. Instead of taking his tragedic past and using it to inspire him to be better, he twists it into a morbid cause.""Crucifying Angel"" is a suspense that will take the reader on a pulse-pounding thrill ride and give them an ending that begs for a sequel.",A Suspenseful Story!,1273276800,0,0

"This book (like others by this author) has received mixed reviews (let us leave the clearly fake ones aside) therefore I waited until I could get it as a freebie on Am.Ms Cole can write. There are some grammar mistakes but her writing is fluid and well paced.Unfortunately all of her contents are simplistic to say the least.""You're their Alpha,"" ... ""But we both know who's the lead in this relationship."" - These nice words are uttered in earnest by one of the leads to the other. I may be Italian and fiery but should anyone dare to speak them to me, even someone I loved, I would down him with a broken nose.Real relationships -healthy ones I mean, other sorts I am not interested in, especially not in a romance- always see a balance of strengths and weaknesses between the partners but the key-word is exactly that: ""partners"". Two people on an equal footing.Ms Cole's relationships are all about ""mating"". The lovers involved have no say in it: as soon as they are mated they become blubbering fools with no control whatsoever on their trousers. Are they straight and find themselves with a male mate? Their loss, as their mate could theoretically force them to submit.Life in the pack is all about hierarchy, by the way. Obnoxiously so. Which might be realistic but if realism is the point, why are the female shifters in this story that tame? In nature she-wolves have no problem in baring their fangs to annoying males.The end result is that this short story, the first episode in a series, is short on plot, even shorter and more disappointing in characterization and very rich in banter between two leads engaged not in exploring their feelings but in establishing who is submitting to whom.Am I going to read the next instalments?

"I subscribed to the Kindle Nation Daily for over a week, taking advantage of the two week free trial.

"Stephanie Lewis is the new housekeeper for Cory Booker and his father. On the run from an abusive ex, she doesn't trust easily nor does she let down her guard. She can't afford to - she has someone innocent to protect.Cory Booker is an ex rodeo cowboy turned rancher. Never one to want a woman for more than one night at a time, he is somewhat taken aback by his feelings for his new housekeeper. The fact that he senses she is hiding something keeps him on his toes and ever watchful. He knows without a doubt that she is in trouble and vows to himself that she will be safe - in his arms.Stephanie was a classic case of abuse. Made to feel worthless for years, she was striving to become more independent even while trying her best to stay hidden. Her trust in men was non-existent, and I loved watching Cory change her mind and begin to make her believe in forever.Slow paced at times, Cory's Salvation was a good read.

For the life of me, I could not understand why she couldn't figure out that she needed to be by herself and learn to love as well as embrace herself as a woman.  I know there are women out here who feel that they cannot be without a man but this damn story was just ridiculous!!  When a woman can truly understand her self worth then she will not settle for just anything.  Therefore, most men who have any sense will know they cannot just bring any type of BS game to her.I do not agree with one or a couple of the other reviews about Craig being the man even though he ""only"" did the internet flirting.  What you females do not understand is that internet flirting turns into other things such as ""let's get together"", ""I'm not feeling my significant other right now, so how about we hook up?"", etc.  Furthermore, if you remember, Craig was also sending females pictures of his private parts as well as receiving pictures of theirs.

"This is a novella, actually it's part of a novella, if we were talking regular book, I think it would be the first few chapters (3 maybe 5).  This is about Leslie, Irial and Niall.  I enjoyed reading about Leslie again, but for those who miss Seth Ash and Keenan, you probably won't like this short story.In a smaller nutshell, Stopping Time shows glimpses into Leslie's life as she tries to move on and live without seeing Niall or talking to Irial. This of course doesn't prevent Irial from visiting her or Niall from calling her on the phone a lot.  Leslie I don't think realizes yet that she won't be able to move on.  She has a choice that she won't make, she can't touch Irial without fatal consequences, and to be with Niall means she has to become one of the monsters in the Dark Court, either way she loses who she is.I really enjoyed the story, I'm one of the fans that don't mind branching out with different characters, in fact I hadn't read about Leslie since Ink Exchange, so I was very pleased Melissa Marr gave us this two part story.  At only a dollar you have to ask yourself if you want to know whether or not Leslie comes back in to the Fey fold or not. I have already pre-ordered the second part in the book which will be released at the end of this month I believe.","3 stars, short but nice",1268697600,18,18
"Even for a free book, this was unusually bad.It is in dire need of attention from a copy editor.  The author seems to have a special aversion to commas, as dozens and dozens are missing in places where you would usually expect to see them.The story is choppy and rushed.  Characters are barely introduced and important parts of the story are never fully explained (Why is Liam going to high school with humans?  Why exactly do the Seelies hate Jensen and her mother?  What exactly happened to the Principal?  Why did Jensen have the ability to lie when no other faerie could?  Where is Jensen's mother and why did she do such a poor job of preparing her for her life?  What exactly happened at the party?  Why does Jensen hate Zoe's sister so much - just because she doesn't like her?).  The books seems to assume a level of familiarity with faerie legend and backstory.  Key concepts and terms are thrown about and never explained.  I felt like every third paragraph or so was just mysteriously cut from the book  - that is how cut-up and incomplete the story was.  It's like the author took an anti-exposition pledge.",Unusually bad,1311292800,5,5

"Subtitled The Misadvententures of an Indadequate Teacher says enough. Thrift by Phil Church is a kind of story I kept wondering about. What's the reason for writing this? Why telling this?

"I have read the entire True Mates series so far.  It has its ups and downs.  I did not feel that Nikolai's Wolf is one of the better installments in the series.  The character development and the development of the primary relationship in the novel simply left a lot to be desired.  Nikolai came off more as creepy than mysterious half the time, and that is not good for a lead alpha male.  More obsessed than truly in love, kind of like a stalker at times.  He had so much potential as a character it was really a shame how this played out.  It seemed that most of the book their ""relationship"" consisted of him invading her dreams and inducing her to feel for him with the blood and mental exchange.  The sad thing is that the characters had good chemistry once they were face to face and should have been allowed to develop that chemistry on the page without all the seemingly manipulative actions on his part.  While it is true that the world was definitely developed better in this book, and there are a few nice follow-up stories set up, the fact is that to me all that is secondary to the relationship between the main characters.  I felt that left a lot to be desired.  The potential was there, but it just never went beyond that.  Too much manipulation, without balancing the story with the honest face time needed for the relationship to blossom into a believable love story on the page.  This book is just not my cup of tea.  There are people who will like it of course.  I just don't happen to be one of them.  I much prefer book 2 ""Mary and the Bear"" and book 4 ""Tameka's Smile"".  ""Mary and the Bear"" was all about the relationship between the main characters which I loved.  It did not have much information on the world or pack dynamics.  Then again, the book dealt with a bear shifter, not a wolf.  Hugh was not a part of the wolf pack so they only get mentioned as side characters.  ""Tameka's Smile"" also developed the relationship between the characters well, and the story itself was wonderful.  While ""True Mates"" started the series as book 1, it was not a highlight of the series either.This book was just ok, nothing outstanding, and definitely not a book I will re-read.  I got all the information I needed from it the first time I read it in order to keep tabs on the series. If you are following the series I recommend you read it, otherwise you may miss some information which may be important later on.  However be aware that this is not really the crowning jewel of the series.  The potential was there, but the story falls short.",Not the best in the series,1272844800,0,0

"As a Christian, it's really so refreshing to read Christian fiction that ISN'T romance, but still speaks to my worldview. I also have a keen interest in Eastern Europe (I studied Russian at university), and on a totally shallow level, three books for three quid was a pretty good offer.So I had high hopes for The Russian.I've seen a number of reviews going ""yuck, Christian fiction!"" but as one might imagine, that's not my problem with this book. My problem was that it just wasn't well written, and I got to the stage where I just couldn't make myself keep reading.It started off pretty well, with a rather mysterious chap getting offed in a Paris cafe. Not a cheery start, admittedly, but at least intriguing. Unfortunately, things gradually went downhill from there. There is way, way too info-dumping going on; one entire chapter is the main character (Alex) sitting reading a file of information about Ukraine. Such an info dump is occasionally necessary, and it's not even that the information itself is dull; this info dump is just handled really badly. The whole ""Alex is reading this file and these are the bits you need to know"" conceit simply doesn't work.It wouldn't be so bad, but this is not even the first such dump - only a few chapters previously Alex had splurged her life history, ostensibly to prove her language skills (she is supposed to be speaking in Russian at that point), but mainly as a really lazy way to give us vast swathes of her background in one huge (and, to be honest, really boring) chunk.There are a lot of stereotypical characters: for example, a couple who are executed (we only meet them for about five minutes before their deaths) are 'foot soldiers' with a cause whose validity is 'open to argument', and they are portrayed, in their short vignette, as basically party people who do a lot of drinking, clubbing, wife swapping and threesomes. The reader is so clearly supposed to seem them as ""baddies"" that it's a little cringe-worthy.I also found the extraneous information got overwhelming and annoying. A couple of characters early on whose only point seems to be to place a bug in a character's flat had all sorts of information that I didn't know and didn't actually care about thrown in (and on top of that they came across as a bit stupid, to be honest... seriously, would someone who worked in this capacity really not be able to tell Gorbachev and Yeltsin apart??).Another character is introduced in this timeless(!) piece of prose:""He had a mop of gray hair and a reddish face. He wore a crimson tie and a cream-colored shirt. He was flanked by a half-finished container of Starbucks, the tall one with the full day's caffeine punch.""For starters, the only bit of remotely interesting or relevant information in these three sentences is that he's a coffee drinker - which is hardly surprising (he's in the US State Department). Why the author felt the need to tell me random and dull pieces of information about his attire I'm not sure, but even the style in which it's told is ugly. ""He had brown hair and blue eyes. He wore a blue suit..."" - this is the kind of description I expect from a child, not a published author! How some of this prose ever got through editing without someone saying, ""Hang on a tick, this could use some serious tightening up"" I really can't imagine.In the same vein, a long description of the Nigerian 419 scam seems to be to be something which either you know about (and therefore really don't need the detailed run down of how it works) or you don't know about (and therefore don't actually care and wonder why anyone would be stupid enough to send their bank details to a random Nigerian). The detailed explanation of how the scam worked just added nothing to the story, and was yet another piece (and only a few chapters in) of extra padding.Similarly, we're treated to a detailed run down of Alex's activities at the gymn, only one of which (her baseball game) appeared to be adding anything to the story. I really didn't need to know, nor care about, her grabbing her stuff, heading back to the lockers, and having a quick shower. There is way, way too much of this kind of detail bogging down the writing.All of the above could, though, be forgiven as far as I am concerned - it's not great writing, but I'd live with it, and the plot (despite being slowed down to almost a full stop by the neverending padding) looked like it might be quite interesting. The deal-breaker for me is how annoying the main character was. She is too perfect - too much of a Mary Sue. She's beautiful, speaks five languages, she excels in everything she does, she's engaged to a well-muscled but also super-intelligent and honourable guy... and still she manages to come across as rather whiny, self-righteous and judgemental. She also seemed rather naive for a woman who's supposed to be a fed who's served on active duty in a country like Nigeria... ""Horrible things like that only happened to other people."" (I also couldn't help wondering if that was a piece of foreshadowing that even Stephenie ""let me spell out my plot for you just in case you're a bit dim"" Meyer would think was heavy handed...)I'm a Christian - and I really struggled to like her. I couldn't empathise with her, and she didn't feel real, feel human, at all. Thinking of what it would be like reading this from a non-believer's point of view, and imagining that many readers would take this as ""what Christians are like"", made me cringe.Basically, I really, really wanted to like this,and I kept going as long as I could because it looked like it might have a decent, interesting plot, and I imagined it would at least be a cut above some of the Christian drivelly romances that seem to dominate the Christian-fiction market. For being a little different, I'm grudgingly giving one star. But poor writing and a main character who I just didn't want to spend time with added up to a book I felt I was wasting my time reading. Overall: really disappointing, and I'm just glad I grabbed it on offer not at full price.",So disappointing - I wanted to love this.,1335312000,3,3

"This wasn't a bad book, but I didn't think it was that great.One thing I didn't like about Damon is that the story never seems to answer questions. I mean, sure, okay, some books can pull of the whole open-ended technique really well. I didn't think this was one of them.For example, I started the story thinking that Damon was perhaps an incarnation of the devil- the similarity between the names Damian and Damon, made me think maybe there was a connection there. That, and the fact that he wears people's faces.But as the story progresses, you realize he's just an obsessive psychopath hooked on cocaine (I guess?) and there's no hint of the paranormal anywhere else in the story. But if that's the case, how is he wearing people's faces and getting away with it?If you're not worried about knowing all the answers, and like to have things unexplained, then this is good.I can say in its defense, however, that it was well-written and did manage to creep me out a bit.

"I like the cover to this, thought I'd point that out.  I like that Lucinda's hair is a brilliant contrast to the sheets and her skin. The red hair is a fairly important attribute since its not an 'ordinary' color paired with her eyes in the story.The synopsis is what caught my attention.  It doesn't mention a few pertinent details (she's married), and some of what it talks about is glossed over in the novella itself (there's really no indication of her dislike or interest in the ton).  Where the story really shined was in portraying the seductive dance that Lucien and Lucinda engage in.  They're powerfully attracted to each other from the first, there's no doubt on that.  Even while being abducted Lucien had control over how quickly lust hit him and Lucinda was oggling him quite a bit.Wolffe draws out Lucinda's reasons and story, which frustrated me at times as much as it did Lucien.  She'd let little tidbits fall, but other then vague indications of what was happening there was nothing until around the middle of the story.  Truth be told the excuse Lucinda uses is rather flimsy and Lucien cuts through that logic pretty quickly. As far as plot device needed to keep them in bed as often as possible, it worked quite well, but logically it was ridiculously flawed.I was also rather skeptical about several plot turns.  Maybe I'm just too naive and innocent in the ways of the bedroom, but can you honestly go a couple days without remembering to eat or drink and do nothing but make love?  And later Lucinda's husband seems to go from 'this is what I want' to 'jealous rage' (which is acceptable and understandable all things given) but then...the ending.  Wolffe didn't show us, or even hint to us, how Lucien and the husband finally came to some arrangement.  I can't be sure if she had a word count restraint or if she just felt the talk didn't need to be explained since it the evidence was shown, but it was confusing for me.What I did really enjoy was the cast of secondary characters.  From Lucinda's feisty servants to her husband and brother, they sparkled.  I loved that Maddy was so outspoken and quick with her temper (and fists).  Not that she was violent, persay, but very passionate and loyal to those she cared about.  She cared little for rank--if you pissed off her protective instincts its a slap for you.  The interactions between the characters were all warm and genuine feeling, you could feel the affection they all held for each other and for Lucinda.And in truth it was nice to read a romance where there were no 'villains' persay.  The only villains spoken of were Lucinda's in-laws, but they're given a broad stroke as 'greedy' and 'rotten'.  Beyond the fact that they'd hurt Lucinda, we learn very little else.I would recommend this if you are looking for a hot and satisfying read.

"After reading the first chapter and a few pages of the second, I just finally gave up on this title. I felt the descriptions were explaining and telling me about the characters, world background, etc., rather than just describing and letting me put the pieces together.

"The frustrating thing about the ""Scintillating Samples"" series is that some stories stand perfectly well on their own and others do not.  This is one of the ones that doesn't.Minnie (or Minerva) is the main character.  She has a ton of back story inelegantly crammed into a small space.  She was married to an abusive ""brownshirt"" (apparently it is 1936 in this story, but there is absolutely nothing to tip you off to that) who died.  Her daughter-in-law is a ""Druid"" and is reading her mind at all times.  The ""Druid"" thing makes little sense when you think the story is set in the present-day and zero sense when you realize the story is set in the 1930s.The plot is just pure silly wish fulfillment.

They are having trouble solving the case and one of the young constables takes a shining to Julia.  Then the mysterious Lady Law gets involved.  Lady Law has solved every case she has taken on for investigation and she wants to take on Julia's case pro bono.  Ends up there is more mystery behind Julia's sister's death and behind Lady Law herself than anyone ever thought.This story was decently written and easy to read.  I enjoyed the reimagining of Victoria London to a place populated by dirigibles and steam-based contraptions.  The descriptions of contraptions was interesting and unique.  The characters don't have a ton of depth to them but they are all easy to relate to and fairly engaging.  This book really shines in some of the descriptions of settings which really make the city come alive for the reader.  I also enjoyed the strong and plucky female characters throughout.The plot was okay.  It takes some interesting twists and the book is tied up nicely.  I thought the way things ended was a bit contrived and odd, but that's all I can really say without spoilers.  This is definitely more of an adult read.Overall I enjoyed this novella.  While the writing style and plot are nothing spectacular, the book was still entertaining.  I did enjoy the strong female characters, the world-building, and the description of steampunk contraptions.  I am uncertain as to whether or not I will read future works by Appleton.  As I said this book was a fun quick diversion, but it wasn't anything especially spectacular.",Interesting and entertaining steampunk romp with a wierd ending,1299715200,0,0

"The story started very promising. Heroin falls almost in the arms of our hero (okay, she fell on the hard floor, he wasn't that quick  ) and they feel instantly attracted to each other. There are also interesting flashbacks about Devi's strange brother Kai. Very interesting, since I've never heard of an angel kidnapping children. Aren't they supposed to be on the good side?But then... Then they start talking and won't stop. The alternation between action and endless conversations could have been done a bit better. I had to put the book down repeatedly. I just couldn't keep my attention on the story. I also had a problem with the helplessness  of Devi at some times. All she apparently could do was wait for rescue. Isn't it a bit boring to have to wait all the time...However, there was something I found truly amazing. When Oz shot Devi, deliberately, I was totally okay with her not harboring any feelings of resentment towards him. Katherine Pine wrote this part in such a way that everything was explained and everything happened with a reason. I even started to get irritated when he kept apologizing afterwards, cause he didn't have to! When I start to think about it, it's a little scary that she was able to make me feel okay about it... You normally wouldn't be okay with something like this, would you?I'm still confused about the difference between a demon and a devil. Apparently there's some big difference between them and that's important in the book, but I still don't know what it is. It looked like the term was used at random. I at least couldn't notice what the big difference was. What a spirit and a soul are, is explained a bit better, but at the end I still don't get what they mean....It was hard to get an overall rating for this one. There were parts of the story I really liked (a car plastered with pads ^^), but there were also parts I had to struggle to get through (how she treated Camael....). Therefore 3 stars. It was a bit better than a normal ""OK"", although it's not a full ""I liked it."" I don't know if I want to read the next book, since the story seemed finished to me. I hope that , if I do read it, she'll treat Camael better!",Good and bad...,1337472000,0,0
"It's hard for me to like a book when I don't like the main character too much. Josh isn't a likeable boy. He has so much anger and hatred boiling inside of him and he lashes out and rages against everyone. He's had it pretty rough. His mom died leaving him alone with his dad, and Josh hates his mother for dying. His dad's a real piece of work, making me cringe every time he makes an appearance. Josh has a true friend in Brian's mom -- Brian is his best friend who is in the coma. She must see some good inside of Josh that everyone else is having a hard time finding. He's very fortunate to have his second chance at Shining Star Boy's Ranch. Though when he first gets there, he's anything but cooperative. The people running the place must've truly been saints with an endless supply of patience. I did like the book, and am glad I stuck with Josh to the end.",Bad Boy Unlikeable Boy,1338854400,0,0
"Guardian is a short story by Elita Daniels and focuses on vampire Anna who was turned 8 years ago.  Vampirism is an infection that was accidentally discovered 30 years ago during a scientific experiment.  It is passed on by other vampires who are `carriers' of the disease through their venom when they bite people.  Once turned a vampire must go into a camp where they are experimented on like animals in a lab. They are mistreated, abused and tortured all in the name of science to see how much of a threat they will be to society.  Once released the vampires must take a cocktail of drugs to control their blood lust.  They are also assigned a human protector, a Guardian, who is a bit like a parole officer.This isn't your usual paranormal book.  There are no other creatures or special powers or battles etc as vampirism was accidentally invented by scientists.  There are no hunting demons or a big case to solve.  It just follows Anna who is a carrier vampire and her struggle with ordinary life and I really liked that, it made a change for me.  I sort of liked Anna she is a complicated character one minute then she is fine the next she acts very strange, she also acts kind of crazy and I just wanted to give her a slap at times.  Anna finds it very difficult to trust and love people, she prefers one night stands to a relationship and this is a big part of the book.  She has two completely different love interests and I was truly shocked to find out what happens in both relationships.  The story is very dark, Anna is abused in the book and she is deceived by those she finally comes to trust.  The characters are quite unpleasant people and I cheered when one finally met his demise.  The vampires are not sparkly they are dangerous sadistic people who like to play with humans and not in a good way.  The book is extremely fast paced.  At times I thought I had missed a page as the story jumps about so much and this did out me off.  I have mixed feelings about this book, on one hand I liked the different take on vampires by Ms Daniels and I do like to read dark stories but then on the other it was just too fast.  The story ends very abruptly another negative for me it was like the last page didn't get printed.  On a plus point I feel that this could be a great book if it was fleshed out, wasn't as fast paced and more time spent on it, I also love the cover.  If you like dark gritty writing maybe you should give this book a go.  I would like to give this book 3 stars.",A confusing mixture,1319587200,2,2

"I honestly don't know how I finished this book or even why. This book had me so frustrated that I put it down a numerous amount of times. I kept picking it up hoping that it would get better. Sadly, I was wrong. This book was just all over the place. I also had a lot of trouble connecting to the characters.The character Leanne was just all over the place. When we are first introduced to her she seems very timid and worries about hurting others feelings and she also has a very low self esteem. She has been told consistently by her mother that she needs to me more like her mother's Goddaughter Gillian who is actually a vapid whore. When Leanne meets Brandon, she is very timid at first but somehow after only a few minutes she becomes this brazen vixen. Then, after their sexual encounter she goes back to being timid again. It was like this throughout the book. One moment she is timid and innocent and the next a cursing sexually aggressive woman. It was very annoying.As for Brandon's character I felt like I couldn't get a good read on him either. In the beginning of the book he is very much aware of his sexual persona and is very self-assured male. Then later on, he just seems to fizzle out. I felt he became a slight pushover and was only concerned about Leanne needs and not his own.Also, some of the plot in this book just seemed a bit contrived and not very realistic. Don't even get me started on the ending. It just felt so fake with everything being wrapped up with a bow. It felt so unrealistic and fake. It just left me with a sour taste in my mouth.",I wish I could have liked this book..,1311379200,2,2

"Emily's dreamed of a life with the Donovan brothers - Greer, Taggert and Sean.  It broke her heart when Greer and Taggert rejected her but Sean accepted everything she had to offer and never resented the fact that she also loves his older brothers.  They had a happy marriage and Emily loved her singing career until a horrible tragedy destroyed it all.Unable to face life without Sean and blaming herself for his death, Emily attempts to hide away from reality and goes through the motions of living.  Singing has been such a driving force in her life but even that is something she feels she can no longer do.  Her day to day existence is disrupted though by a knock at her door.  Greer and Taggert have found her and they have no intention of letting her continue along the lonely path she's currently on.Greer and Taggert have always called Emily `their Songbird' and it breaks their heart to see her so sad and disinterested in life.  Even worse is the realization that she hasn't allowed herself to cry.  Greer and Taggert miss their little brother Sean too, but there's nothing they can do to bring him back.  Their biggest regret is rejecting Emily when she came to them and expressed her love for them all.  If they hadn't sent her away then Emily and Sean would have never left Mountain Pass ranch and Sean would still be alive.  They're determined to help her heal and restore the joy she once found in life and song.  Greer and Taggert's concern for Emily doesn't end there though - they love her and want to spend the rest of their lives with them.  As the lovers come together and begin to forge a life together an old threat resurfaces and threatens to destroy their happiness.Maya Banks really pulls at readers' heartstrings with her newest release SONGBIRD.  Emily's heartbreak and loneliness following Sean's death are easily understandable and show the difficulties she experiences carrying on without him.  Taggert and Greer's love for Emily is evident in everything they do - including enforcing a little tough love and forcing her to live the rest of her life to the fullest.  SONGBIRD is a beautiful romance that stems from a horrendous tragedy which not only shows the strength of will it takes to simply get out of bed each day but also the effect such an event would take on doing anything you once enjoyed.  Maya Banks' writing has always evoked an emotional response for me and SONGBIRD definitely had me hanging on to each and every word anxious to find out what happens between these memorable characters.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies,1251849600,3,3

So reading the blurb I thought racy story about two people trapped in a cabin. Sounds ok. What I wasn't prepared for was the sweet romance and good story.  Both  Genevieve and Alex have been hurt in the past. I liked the way Alex had such an open mind about Genevieve's special talents. He didn't try to explain them away or ignore them. Genevieve was much less excepting of her talents than Alex was. Being on her own for so long with major preconceptions about her past actions and character. It was great to see Alex blow her preconceptions out of the water.These two were down to earth and I liked seeing them get to know each other.  They saw each others supposed flaws and strengths so differently.  It was obvious they saw things in each other that hadn't been uncovered and would lead to change in the future.  This was the first book I read by Alisha Rai and I liked her style.  This book was a good mix of relationship building and steamy encounters. It was a standalone book and from what I can see she doesn't have any plans to turn it into a series. Which is fine sometimes it's just nice to read a great story!,Great book!,1371686400,0,0

"When I initially reviewed this book I was angry and frustrated, and it showed. I want to be honest about the book, but I feel I could do without the sarcasm. My rating of the book, however, stays the same and for the same reasons.The initial idea behind the plot is interesting. Bree is sent as a replacement bride to marry Ruan. There are people who wish to harm both of them, and they struggle to build their relationship while fleeing their enemies.Great, but there really IS Not a build-up of a relationship between the two main characters. What I experienced was a Moe and Curly routine a la Three Stooges; an unfortunate series of sight gags and pratfalls. Bree, who had managed to survive her own hard life, suddenly becomes a klutz and injures herself repeatedly. Additionally, Bree cries copiously, and Caine uses words to describe Bree's crying that are very unappealing. ""Sniveling"" is one such word, repeated often. I don't know if the author is aware of the very negative connotation this word has because I am sure she would not have chosen it if she did. When Bree is not crying, she really doesn't DO much until the final few chapters of the book when she finally developes a backbone. Other characters talk and react to events, but Bree is usually silent. I soon became frustrated and bored with the character.There are numerous problems that I have with the book, but the lack of any believable relationship between Bree and Ruan is a close second to the lack of a likeable heroine. The big romantic scene never comes, and I don't mean a big sexual scene, but just a point in the novel when they both characters show their love for each other, with words and actions. The final culmination, after watching the two meander through the plot, is a nonevent. I was left not feeling much of anything for the two characters because they seemed to feel very little themselves.Caine, however, does a credible job when it comes to the settings of the story. Caine does a nice job in describing the scenery, the buildings and the atmosphere that the characters step into, so the reader can ""see"" what the characters see. I wish she could have transferred some of that detail to the fleshing out of her characters.","Already deleted my first review, but rating stays the same...",1327017600,19,19

"I live in Boston and had been waiting for the Boston Globe to become available for the Kindle since mine arrived on December 4, 2007. I subscribed the first day I found out about it and have not been disappointed. I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess). Some pictures are now beginning to appear too. The ads are gone (so unless you only buy the paper for the ads - some people do - you will be pleased). The Contents, Sections and Next Article layout is great. From the main page you can just skim all the headlines by hitting the next page button until you get to the end - and then you'll know you haven't missed any of today's headlines. If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there). The only thing that's missing is the comics and the death notices but you can read those on-line at the comic sites in the first case and the Globe's site in the case of death notices - if you really, really want to.Good job.",Finally!

"BEFORE HER EYES by AUTHOR REBECCA FORSTER is a dynamite book!  Being an ex-cop, I like to think I'm darned good at figuring out ""who-done-it"".  REBECCA FORSTER's 'BEFORE HER EYES"" gripped me on the first page and did not let me go until the shocking end. Sheriff Dove Connelly is a great lawman, but he has a lot of baggage.  When his close friend is brutally murdered, leaving a cancer stricken wife, Dove is intent on bring his killer or killers to justice.  A ""missing"" world class model who may have witnessed the murder is not far from his mind.  Tessa Bradley (the model) tells her story, but Dove does not see it - we can.  There is a bad cop too, and I hate a bad cop. You do not find out ""who-done-it"" until the very end - and it sure had me in complete suspense.  You get a vivid description of every character and some you really like, others may even scare you.  This is the third novel by REBECCA FORSTER I have had the pleasure of reading, now I move into the ""WITNESS"" series by REBECCA FORSTER.  If you have not read a REBECCA FORSTER novel yet, you are cheating yourself out of great entertainment.  I highly recommend ""BEFORE HER EYES"".",GRIPPED ME TO THE END,1317772800,0,0

"This is a good read, particularly for anyone that has done their own military service. It seems that perhaps the author wrote this more as a function of his own personal therapy or at least he seems to have had a strong identiy with his main characters. The character development is very good and the story line is also well done. However, his frivolty over the character that was his battalion commander is patterned after Colonel David Hackworth, who was quite a warrior and as a result kept his men alive. This author will shape his writing skills and his next story will improve. It is only hoped that he maintains his passion for the tale itself.

"I'm having a little trouble writing this review. Not because I don't know what I want to say, but because I don't want to write the exact same review 15 other people already have. The truth is, however, that just like a number of previous readers, I found the idea of this story fascinating but the execution lacking. Jack, Silver, and Jersey's destiny was an interesting one, but there were a number of plot holes and a couple just curiosity holes.I thought that the characters were a little flat and I greatly disliked the way that Silver was constantly treated as a child. She had trained her WHOLE life to be a werewolf hunter. Jack had just been introduced to the art. But everyone was willing to let him take the lead and all of the risks. Why? Was she really so weak? If so, how had she survived so long without him? I mean she's part of the prophecy (or whatever) too. It smacked of paternalistic sexism...have to protect the precious, fragile female at all cost. Oh god, just gag me.I did really appreciate Jersey Clifford in all of his poetry spewing badness. He felt like he had more depth than all of the other character combined. Cowboy and Lily had a lot of potential too. Similarly the interaction between Jack and his brother was thought provoking. Billy's experience surely had to be the hardest of any other character. He deserves some credit.It was hard to reconcile the 'we have to save the world' plot line with the 'innocent love' storyline. I suppose if I was 15 and didn't know how much more life had to offer I might be able to relate to the importance of being a couple (holding hands, carrying her books, etc). But as an adult I found the whole thing too...too vanilla. Granted, I am an adult and this is a YA book (and I'd expect it to best appeal to the lower age brackets of the genre). But even if I could get excited about it, I have a hard time believing two people tasked with such a heavy destiny would stop in the middle of it to cuddle and declare their undying love. Not the time people.My final and extremely inelegant say on the matter is that the book was alright and will likely appeal to Twilight's younger fan base.",good for YA readers,1360627200,7,7

"If I Die Young is such a heartwarming story. The writing makes it feel so realist. There is a nice mixture of drama, friendship and romance.Caelyn is a typical teenager who has asthma. One day at school she gets shortness of breath and collapses. She comes to find out that she has heart failure. As the story progresses Caelyn is told that she will need a heart transplant and soon to survive. The first half of the book is very sad and just breaks your heart reading it. I can't imagine having a loved one dealing with something like this. Caelyn and her best friend Lindsy's relationship was so strong.

"I read this book several months ago and have needed some time to let my thoughts on it percolate. There are a number of things I liked about this story, but there are numerous challenges as well.First, I enjoyed the setting a lot. I grew up in the KC area and could easily visualize the streets and school setting. The book starts slow, maybe too slow. Some people were disturbed by the descriptions of torture right up front and that bothered me a bit as well. But I think I would have been less disturbed if there had been some kind of well-defined reason or payback for it. The world building is inventive and intriguing. I am also fascinated by the possibly scientific explanation for the magic, but this is something that needs more development. I wish I could say as much for the characters. Aside from John Lyon, the main character who is transported to a different world via an access under the stairs in his new, supposedly haunted, home, none of the characters had any redeeming qualities to be seen. Except for maybe his friends in this world, but their roles are pitifully minor.Although an editor is credited, it is clear that his degree was not English. Just because you are a professor doesn't mean you have mad grammar skills. For example: ""Three, threatening shadows"", ""livered servants (Were they wearing liver? Or just had intact livers?)"", ""hot, berry pies"", ""then hads of cities"", extraneous exclamation points and other questionable punctuation choices, etc.There's promise here, but it needs some more work. 2.5 stars.",Almost there,1345680000,3,3
"The book started out grabbing my interest. The author did a great job describing the surgery and the problems that led up to it. Also did a good job showing how Anna was learning to deal with the two sides of her brain.  The murderer of the story was ok but I felt needed to be more fleshed out. Many times the two parts of the story didn't seem to flow together and some of the dialogue between the Detectives, Anna's parents, and Caroline were unbelievable.  I didn't feel that enough research was done with the police aspect of the story and so it really didn't work.In spite of this I enjoyed the story up until the trial.  Then it seemed to just drag on. Also adding a touch of romance at the end seemed as an after thought.  I think the Author has a great story idea, she just needs to do some editing and develope the personalities of her characters.

"I effing hated this book! The characters are so juvenile and immature. The only reason I forced myself to continue reading this whole joke--which only fueled my anger--was because I had hoped they would grow and mature. Their issues, especially the heroines, are petty and insignificant like those of a tween with her first zit and equating it to the end of the universe.The writing was okay, but dialog was pretty crappy. Fraught with too many Uh's and Um's for my taste... kind of like that of a child who's vocabulary hasn't been expanded on by education yet. Editing is excellent! It's odd... great books are always poorly edited and poor books are always superbly edited in my experience. Oh well.

I certainly won't be reading the other books in the series because, judging by the other characters in this one, they're all of questionable maturity as well. Except Will...maybe.

"This book had a lot of information that I found myself either writing down to look up later or just going straight to the internet.So many interesting ideas.I have always been interested in the Gnostic scriptures and the author uses many quotes from them.This novel started out really great kept me turning the pages like mad,but than we got to the last few chapters where for me it got way to preachy.The end was really blah!Its the last 3 chapters and the end that is the reason I gave it only 2 stars,it just fell apart.",started out good,1372982400,0,0
"For whatever reason, Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The ""Tales of..."" are great in that they explain background characters. However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist. Also, just to note, this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars), so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version.","Too short, not enough story",1285286400,8,8

For one, I'm from the Natchitoches, La. area and from the first chapter I could tell the author had never even visited Natchitoches.The author needed much more research to make this title accurate in details.

Some of the overseas action was not that believable, but it was, after all, a novel, and with many books of this genre, you have to suspend belief for the sake of the plot. It was an entertaining read that only cost 99 cents, so it is hard to find fault, but I don't think it measures up to the standard of the author's earlier books.",Not as good as the Jonathan Quinn series,1315526400,2,2

"Laws of Thirds by Siom John Lee is a book that covers the many reason that our brains work in 3's.  Lee does a great job explaining the many different concepts for why this occurs, as well as why we don't work in 2's or 4's, etc.  The information covers a very interesting concept.This book was a very easy and quick read that was broken down into several small sections.  That being said, I feel that many of these sections could have been combined.  For example, the different numbers are all broken down into their own sections, though I feel that the maybe should have been combined into a single section.  I feel that there was a ton of ""filler"" information that wasn't really needed.

"I received a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes.  I read it in one day. A new twist on the classic Dickens tale A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Though it had the same premise as the Dickens classic, it is its own story.  I found the authors' substitutes for the ghosts surprising, and the inclusion of angels was a nice touch.  Unlike the classic, this is definitely a romance.  There's even some hanky panky, which I thought was unnecessary. Daphne was a likeable character (sweet and sassy).  I'm still not sure how I feel about Nathaniel (scrooge).  Though this is a Christmas story, I didn't feel it was overly ""Christmasy"" so it could be read any time (I normally read holiday stories around the holidays).  I liked that author added an epilogue to let the reader know what happened to the characters.

"What to say about Alain Gomez' Celebrity Space?  It's short.  I liked it.  It's creepy.  I wanted more.That about sums it up in as few words as possible, but you aren't reading this for the teeny-tiny book review.  So, lets see about adding some meat to those descriptions.It is short.  At about 3000 words, it's lunch or coffee break reading, depending on how fast you read.There is an issue the short story author has that a novelist doesn't, and that's the need to pack a lot of punch into very few words.  Celebrity Space is about as long as most novel authors spend on describing the base location and the first meeting of the main character.  And in that space it has to introduce six characters, set up a plot arc, and build a climax.And it's okay at all of those things.  Though I think they could have been done significantly better with about twice as many words (and still would have been a very short story.)  Or done just as well with the same number of words if Gomez had spent less time on the extraneous characters.Mostly I would have liked to have seen more focus on the creep factor, on the visceral reaction of the main character, Dan, to the first hint that something unsavory is going to happen, Dr. Fleischer, an experimental geneticist with a reputation for unethical work.Also, on the short theme, there is this: Celebrity Space doesn't feel finished.  It ends at a logical point, and a bit of a cliffhanger at that.  Now, in a novel, you can do that and leave the reader feeling like they read a whole story, and now it's time to move onto a new story.  With as short as CS is, you don't get the feeling that you've read a whole story.  It feels like you've read the first chapter of a larger story.  Since CS is now out as part of a collection of short stories, my guess is that it really is just the first chapter in a longer story.On the ""I liked it"" theme: it's a solid little set up for a larger story.  There's enough going on to get you interested.  It's not terribly deep or meaningful, but it's quick and entertaining, sort of the literary equivalent of a potato chip.  Tasty, but you want more than one.As for creepy, the write up doesn't really do the story justice.  I'd say it's much closer to the thriller end of the sci-fi spectrum than the adventure side, and from the write up it's hard to tell that.  Even more foreshadowing would have been nice, but given the length, it's a solid effort.There are three other stories in the series.  I haven't read them, yet.  (My to be reviewed list is longer than my arm, so I'm trying to get through more of it fast.)  So, it does look like Gomez has taken care of that issue.  Right now Celebrity Space is free on Amazon, so if you're interested in a crunchy little bit of story goodness, go give it a shot.",Indie Short Story Review: Celebrity Space,1316217600,3,3

"The premise for the story was good, the characters were likeable and the basic rules of fiction were followed. For that, it gets two stars. For the overall skill and quality of the writing, and for the short length and the left-me-hanging ending, it gets none.This story is a good, fast read if you are just looking for something to fill some time in a waiting room, but it's far from a 5-star work. The author could have expanded her descriptions to give us more detailed imagery. Instead, she writes too succinctly in places where she should be painting a picture, and spoils some of the tension and romantic scenes as a result. The work also came off as a little juvenile (meaning both the characters and the author's skill).

"I'll start off with stating that I would definitely recommend that you read this book.  That being said, I gave it three stars because while I like the story, I found it to be.... overly descriptive.  I don't often say that about books, but I can't think of any other way to put it.The issue is that the author spends WAY too much time breaking up the narrative to ""describe"" stuff-  how the water drops look, how the darkness feels, how the fungus looks, etc...  it feels like you get 3 pages of paragraphs describing someone or something in minute detail for every page or so of actual story narrative.  I found it to be very jarring to be jerked out of the story like that.  I definitely enjoy when an author takes the time to set the scene, but I think in this case, it just goes a little too far.I found I had the easiest time following the story when I just scanned through the overly descriptive parts to get a sense of the setting and then picked up the story in between.  I'm looking forward to more work from the author though hopefully with a little better editing.","Worth reading, but could use some cleanup",1294790400,1,1
"The novel starts right in the middle of of Caucasian trailblazers settling further and further west, and doing so by removing native Indians from their lands. So we have Two Bulls and his lost land and fraying family, and John and Mary's unhappy lives on a fruitless farm. Two Bulls is written in a drifting sequences of inner thought while John and Mary tend to be written in a more traditional way. I think this dichotomy is a successful storytelling technique that allows the reader to empathize with both sides of the conflict. The further we go into the story, the more intriguing it becomes as Two Bulls plays a cat and mouse game with John and John and Mary become more and more paranoid and angry with each other.The writing drags a bit in places and becomes repetitive, but it is clear and understandable with few typos (that I noticed). The setting feels authentic enough that I didn't notice incongruities, and both sets of characters are given equal consideration and dignity in their motivations. They feel real enough in their flaws and decisions. The ending wraps everything up nicely. This novella isn't perfect, but it is a very good read nonetheless.","Interesting sort of ""soap opera""ish Western",1345334400,0,0

"As a dyed-in-the-wool Sherlock Holmes fan, I was very pleased with this story. It had a definite Conan Doyle feel about it, and tapped easily into the legendary Sherlock Holmes methods of deduction in this original story about Holmes' encounter with Dracula. It had a touch of the supernatural about it with dark undertones, but was so very well thought-out. These 'unusual' elements took the story to another level with the excellent flow of the story as a whole. For a make-believe believe tale, it made you believe all events were in fact true and plausible. It was a quick, entertaining read, for which I gladly give five-stars and my only tiny gripe would be that I'd have preferred it was part of an anthology of tales by this Conan Doyle imitator (that's a complement by the way). I will certainly be looking out for more of the same by Christian Klaver.(Oh yes, as mentioned in other reviews, the editing needs work).",Totalling authentic invoking nostagia,1397952000,0,0

"Having an intense interest in the Holocaust for most of my adult life, this book was an easy choice when it popped up on my Kindle. I expect to feel disgust, anger and sadness when reading accounts of the Holocaust-what I didn't expect was how this book made me examine myself, and analyze what I believe in my heart...I am struggling to put into words what I am feeling, but I will try...Sol makes the point when talking to the priest that Christians have been taught from birth that the only way is through Christ, and they are all anti-Semitic, even if sub-consciously... I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book. It is a story of incredible courage and perseverance... it will definately make you think!",Made me think...,1334534400,3,3

"I expected a typical mindless military scifi action story, and that's how this book starts.  Then, it becomes a survival tale with a little mystery.  This story delivered more than I expected, and I enjoyed it more for that.The story follows six members of a Marine special ops team as they spearhead an assault on an enemy outpost on a distant world.  When they are cut off from their extraction point, they end up stranded deep underground where they find a huge derelict spaceship.  As they try to treat their injuries, resupply and seek a means of escape, they find that they are not alone.Almost all of the action is concentrated in the beginning and end of the book, but when the action starts, it is intense.  That's not to say that much of the book is dull as writer Michael Marks manages to drive the story with suspense and mystery.  The Marines' exploration of the ship reminded me of the scene in the movie Aliens where the Colonial Marines stalk through a deserted colony.  Marks writes well - his descriptions are very detailed.  Descriptions of the Marines' gear are also very detailed - enough to make them plausible, not outlandish.  Marks doesn't skimp on the science either.  The science behind the tech in the story is explained well - it's not the techiest that I've read, but it's enough to make it believable.I do have some gripes.  First of all, the characters are too cliched and not well developed.  Only one of the characters really comes out of this adventure a different person.  Some of the characters seem to be way too tough to be real.  However, thinking of all the stories of heroism and sacrifice by special forces soldiers, maybe it isn't so far fetched.  Some of the plot points were just a little too contrived.In all, I enjoyed this book very much, and I look forward to reading more from Michael Marks.",A surprisingly good military scifi tale of survival,1339891200,0,0

"I won this book from the Member Giveaways on Library Thing.I was intrigued by this book, for the fact that it is based on a ""true"" Irish witch story.  I also like stories that are from the distant past and the distant future.  This book is set in the distant past. One thing I did not like, although this is purely a personal preference, is the fact that it jumped back and forth between ages of Meredith, the main character.  One section would be from when she was 8, the next section from when she was 15. I had a hard time with that, but like I said, that is purely personal preference.I thought this book was very well written, however.  It is a story of a girl named Meredith, who is sent to work at a very young age for the vicar. This vicar is evil, however, and summons the demon, Legion, selling his own soul and the soul of Meredith for money and power.  Meredith becomes aware of this plan and finds the secret room where the vicar summons Legion and teaches herself how to summon him as well.  Meredith is given a very hard time, as her ""supervisor"" does not like her.  She is eventually accused of witchcraft and thrown in prison to await trial.  The whole time, she is constantly trying to find out where her family has gone to. She triumphs at the end through a series of good fortunes.I did like this book; it was slow at first but it did pick up and it became very interesting to me.

As someone who spent many summers at camp, I could put myself into some of the character's shoes and relate.  If you're looking for a good story, and something that to me is worth good value for the dollar sales price, this will be worth your time with an interesting story and characters.  The characters could have more development, and the author kind of left it open in the end with the possibility of a sequel which I would like to read if it is written.  I did take away one star for a few grammatical and formatting errors, but it by no means takes away from the overall enjoyment.

Basically Maxine is receiving some harassing phone calls and then vandalism and Ryan believes she is in dangers.

True, if he was anything else it probably wouldn't be an interesting read, however, It would have been nice to see a more Alpha woman...if that makes any more sense. But then again the Alpha male situation represents the majority of books for this genre.Overall (Writing style, story line, and general):Overall the writing was well done. I was never left confused or having to re-read something. I did enjoy seeing a more independent woman who didn't want to be a burden to the people in her life. The story line was a little predictable and I wish that authors for this genre in general would write more in depth plots with more twists and turns to provide a more adrenalin filled novel that goes along with the romance.View more of my review and others at my blog: [...]",Alright read,1342742400,0,0

"Some reviewers have been critical of this story because of excessive violence and profanity but I think both were consistent with the plot and realistic to a hostage situation.  That being said, I was disappointed on a few fronts.  The style for me was reminiscent of that from a creative writing class.  The premise was a good one for a short story but there was effectively no character development at all.  Nor did the author elicit empathy or frankly any emotion for any of the characters.  And I was greatly disappointed in the ending.  Very weak.  A caveat: this is a very short story and can be read in minutes.  Following the story were previews of more of the author's works.  Because of its brevity this story really should have been sold as part of an anthology.  If the real purpose of putting out a short story is to expose the reader to other works, then be up front about that and don't charge for the short story.  After reading this one I felt no compulsion to read the excerpts. Had I downloaded a free story knowing the author was using it to promote other works I'd at least have felt obligated to read the previews.",Skip this one,1334102400,2,2

It was a no guilt 'delete'.I don't even think the best author could combine a tomato farmer, Manolo Blahniks, bootscootin' (it seems to be the author's favorite word), health problems (which I think she should research more), a saloon, a clothing designer, a whiny poor little rich girl and a bunch of assorted other characters.  Nothing seemed to gel, too many plots and sub-plots, none of the characters were appealing, and for some reason, the author seemed to throw in random foul language every other page just because she could.  I'm not a prude, I've been known to throw a few good expletives around, but this bad language just seemed to be added for no real reason.The title is great.

"""Before Her Eyes"" is not usually the kind of book I read, but I agreed to review this book as a nice break from the usual fantasy and science fiction books I review.  I thought it would be a quick and easy read of solving a murder mystery in a small town, but I was wrong.  This book is so much more than that and made me do a lot of thinking about how we all judge people based on our own perceptions and biases of who we think they are when we look at them.The story revolves around Sherriff Dove Connelly, a good moral stand-up kind of guy who battles his own inner demons while trying to solve the murder of his friend, Fritz, the local store owner, and the kidnapping of Tessa Bradley, a local socialite, from the scene of the crime.  Throughout the investigation that covers 48 hours, everything that Dove thought he knew about the people of his mountain enclave is challenged, warped and then twisted back into a new slot.  Even Dove himself must undergo this torturous journey if he ever wants to have peace and happiness with his wife and child.The author lets the story unfold through two viewpoints - third person to follow Dove and the investigation and first person for Tessa Bradley.  It is Tessa's voice that draws you in, haunts you, makes you listen to her, and leaves you a shadow of former yourself when she's done with you.  Her beauty blinds all who see her, but no one really sees her, no one really knows her, all except for one, and he's never met her before.  Dove is determined to find Tessa not because she's a beautiful woman, but because she is a woman in need and that's his job.This book makes you think and I like that.  I highly recommend it, but make sure you carve out the time to read it because once you start, you won't want to put it down until the last word is read.I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review.",Thought provoking - a must read!,1285372800,38,38

"A highly trained assassin works for The Office, a covert international spy network with offices worldwide and access to advanced technology. After he falls in love with a South African woman, he resigns from The Office and settles down to build a family life. When his family is brutally murdered, he re-activates himself, resumes his role as an assassin and searches for the person or persons responsible for the death of his family.The story is told from the first person viewpoint of the assassin (as far as I can remember he was never named). The story has a non-linear structure, jumping back and forward both in time and in location. We experience the protagonist's early life as he is trained in martial arts and murder by his controller, in South Africa as he builds his family; we follow him as he executes human targets, and finally in 20xx where he fulfils his final mission.For much of the story, Fraser's brilliant writing skills--lean and rich in imagery--were enough to immerse me within each of the threads. This was particularly true in his descriptions of life in pre and post-apartheid South Africa.As the book progressed, though, I became impatient with the amount of time spent describing the surroundings and the cultures the protagonist found himself in. Large amounts of the text seemed reminiscent of a Theroux-like travelogue and had little to do with moving the story forward. The author (through the guise of his protagonist) holds forth on politics, culture and language, reminding me of an intelligent but annoying dinner guest who, lit by one too many brandies, loudly proclaims his opinions to a captive audience.Labeled a thriller, there were few thrills to be had because the assassin--armed with the overwhelming technology of The Office--seemed to overmatch every opponent. He was cold and calculating and detached--hard to get connected to. Except for one instance, he never seemed to be under threat of failure or discovery.The scenes involving the submarine offered potential for some nail biting, but because they were preceded with a flash-forward that showed the assassin had survived, the challenges and struggled of the submarine's captain and crew offered little tension--I was told they made it.It was all too easy.","Excellent writing, but a disjointed story.",1341187200,1,1

"Hare Moon gets 3 Stars.Hare Moon is the prequel to The Forest of Hands and Teeth and it tells Sister Tabitha's story. Some of this makes The Forest of Hands and Teeth make a little more sense because it is just another piece of the puzzle. Sister Tabitha, when she was younger, it turns out was very much like Mary (or should I say, turns out Mary was very much like a young Sister Tabitha). Tabitha feels a call to the forest, to see if there's more to the outside world than what she's always been told. She feels a call to anything that remains hidden or forbidden from her. Sound familiar? It makes her being so hard on Mary make more sense because she sees herself in Mary, but Tabitha made a very different choice than Mary will make. And I believe Sister Tabitha can see that coming.Tabitha meets a boy and falls in love. And this shows us that the Sister Tabitha we thought we knew from The Forest of Hands and Teeth wasn't always cold and uncaring. She wasn't always without feeling or ambition. She didn't always know which course she was going to take. You get the impression from The Forest of Hands and Teeth that Sister Tabitha views Mary as this horrible person, that Sister Tabitha believes Mary will bring about the downfall of their village, the village she gave up everything to protect, but Mary didn't even push the limits as much as Tabitha did when she was younger. Mary never ventured outside the gates until the breech occurred first. Tabitha did. Mary didn't choose to pursue the ocean until no other option presented itself. Tabitha did. Mary didn't let infection inside the village. Tabitha did. And even though Sister Tabitha could undoubtedly see herself in Mary, it wasn't Mary who brought about the downfall of their village like Sister Tabitha feared.Tabitha is faced with the decision to flee and pursue love or to stay and sacrifice it all for the protection of her village. We all know what she choose.That's the story. Now to how I felt about the story. Tabitha's story so closely follows Mary's own story that it frustrated me. I felt like I was re-reading parts of The Forest of Hands and Teeth. I understand why they needed to be similar in some ways and almost exactly the same in others, but that doesn't mean that experiencing it again under a different name made it feel any different (or any better). The best parts weren't fully explored and the things that frustrated me about Mary I just got to relive through Tabitha. So while I felt this was an addition to The Forest of Hands and Teeth and it did make me understand Sister Tabitha more and why she behaves the way she does in The Forest of Hands and Teeth, this was only worth 3 Stars for me.Let me also say, that I found it hard to say any of this because I love Carrie Ryan's writing (normally).",Hare Moon - 3 Stars,1329177600,3,3
"This book is about an amazing woman. Through the eyes of a child that does not understand what she is suppose to say or do to stop the abuse. She keeps thinking, What am I suppose to say? Not realizing until she is grown and after many years of therapy, that there was no right answer for her. Because, it was not about her. It was about her sick and sadistic father. A mother that when she wasn't part of the abuse, did nothing to stop it. A lot of guilt because it was about survival. If he is hitting someone else, he isn't hitting me.An extraordinary look into how the mind, in order to cope, will shut down when necessary in order to save a persons sanity.Another prime example when your child does not like a neighbor or friend.

"Part of Swain's Jack Carpenter series --I was introduced to Swain with the excellent Valentino books-- Carpenter doesn't make an appearance until about a third into the book. The FBI agent working on the case recommends to a newly in charge agent, Rachel Vick, that she seek Carpenter's advice as one especially knowing about missing persons, abductions, and serial killers, but also as someone more interest in ""justice"" than in the ""law.""  (Ah, those wanting to make that distinction rearing their ugly torsos since, in my opinion, they should not be separate and to permit individuals to define what constitutes ""justice"" is dangerous, indeed.)I have enjoyed some of Swain's other books, particularly his ""grifter"" series. This one, while a fast read that holds the interest, seemed wildly implausible, with a convict in virtual solitary running a serial killer on the outside who recruits to killing through the ""program,"" which seemed to be hardly novel or unusual. And yet the implausible is intermixed with the prosaic but little actual investigation. And the Danni business.  Didn't buy it.

"This is the third story I've read by the author848 (Dark Bites)andLike Cats and Dogs (Dark Bites)are the other two).  Ropars seems to have a clear respect for the history of horror, which should translate into a passion for the genre.  None of that passion, however, makes it into the story.A young woman, Crow Lee, is awoken from a bizarre dream by a sudden sound.  At first she thinks the sound is an earthquake, then she thinks it is a plane crash.  As she logs on to her social networking sites and turns on the news, the truth turns out to be something even more unsettling -- a meteor has struck downtown Chicago and it is having a strange effect on dead bodies.  Crow finds herself having to fight her away out of her high rise apartment building with only the weapons she has on hand.Ropars states that his intention was to place strong women in classic horror situations.  The problem with this story is that the situation was a little too classic -- Crow is surrounded by stock 1960s-style zombies, right down to their muttered pleas for ""brainsssss.""  I wish he had put a bit more of his creative energy into the scenes -- some innovation would have gone a long way.Fans of strong female characters who don't mind a standard situation will still find a lot to enjoy in this story.

"This premise of this book was so promising, but the result was disappointing. It was a decent read, but nothing ""wow"" about it. The character development was shallow to say the least. A reader was not given much background on the hero or heroine, so there was no way for the reader to form an attatchment to the characters.Also, why do interracial writers want to ignore race in the story? It was barely mentioned in this book, and I might as well have been reading any other mainstream novel.That's what happened here, and an opportunity to add spice because of the ommission was missed.There was no great love story going on, the heroine was detached and uncaring and the hero was just there. The author tried her best, but probably should have done a lot more research or received some assistance on writing about the DEA and the ATF. Every scene involving the two agencies was totally unbelievable.To the author's credit, the editing was better than some I've seen in IR romances, but could have used a little work.The bottom line is, there was no passion in this book and the love scenes were lackluster at best.","No ""WOW"" factor",1308009600,4,4

No can do, still absolutely loathed her. She was afraid of everything, including her own damn shadow. This character cried so much, I needed a dramamine just to get through the chapters. It took me forever to finish this book. I wanted so much to like her, I couldn't help but feel that Sylvan got shafted. Her first reaction to everything was with fear, I mean EVERYTHING!!

"The Ryel Saga is a well written book with an immense world filled with unique and satisfying characters and cultures.  The only downside to me was it is a bit heavy on the romance.  That can only be expected with a title like A Tale of Love and Magic, and it did nothing to diminish my overall enjoyment of the book.Ryel's Saga takes him on a very long journey to master his Art (magic), learn his true origins, defeat the evil threatening the world, and find his love.  Along the way we are treated to numerous cities and cultures that are wonderfully described by this gifted author.  I always find references to the literature in the world that is created to be a great insight into the characters.  In this book we are treated to some stories that Ryel grew up enjoying, I always find that a good insight into the character.  This book will take you around the world, break your heart, grant you new and wonderful friends, and you may even fall in love.  There is little else an author can do to improve on that.If anyone is considering getting this book I highly recommend it and if you can do it in the next 2 days it will only be .99 for this 2 volume collection.

"This little story really has a lot going for it.  It involves two people with hangups who get together and help each other overcome their fears.  I liked the fact that the author was able to convey her apparent belief that there are men out there who are kind, gentle, understanding and loving towards women.  I found that refreshing.  This is a short book and, as such, there wasn't time for great character development, but the author did an admirable job within the confines of the story.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of the dialogue and emotionally wrenched by other scenes.  A romantic story which elicits those types of responses is a good one in my book.  The sexual aspects of the story were very well put together and would appeal to both men and women equally.  This is not your typical ""his hands yanked her head back roughly as he took her from behind with brutal abandon"" romance.  It is instead a carefully crafted story about how important caring is within the bounds of a budding relationship.

""The Black Phone"" is one of the stories in Hill's book 20th Century Ghosts.

John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending.

"While I enjoyed reading this book, it never really captured my attention to the extent that I didn't want to put it down. The characters are somewhat flat and undeveloped; for example, it appears in the beginning of the book that Rafe is going to be a major character, but he is out of the story line for much of the book. One of the problems, in my opinion, is that characters who are actually minor characters appear far too often and in totally unnecessary scenes that slow the pace of the story; conversely, characters who are obviously supposed to be the main characters are not fleshed out. More than a few of the plot twists are implausible, given the story line, and that doesn't help this novel.",Great potential left unrealized,1354233600,1,1

Indeed, the author notes seem almost as extensive as the story itself.And not realising it was a shorty story, it still felt a bit thin.

"Goodness me, EnvyNone has put down so eloquently what I feel about this book. First off I must say it was a wonderful book and so enjoyable to see how Rick and Carolyn's attraction developed over time. You could understand how two seemingly different people could fall in love against the odds but even if it all sounds a bit too far-fetched it completely immerses you in the fantasy. The downside was that I occasionally struggled to attribute a name to the dialogue in parts. Also I may be slow on the uptake but some scenes were too cryptic for me; as EnvyNone said I did feel I had walked in the middle of a conversation I knew nothing about and worse; the other parties did not bother to elaborate. So though these issues did not detract much from the engaging story, I could only award 4 star's.  Still, a truly great read and I will be looking out for this author's future work. Other writers of IRR fiction please take note! A solid, well written, articulate story is always worth it's weight in gold.",I agree with EnvyNone,1286668800,1,1

"Reviewer: BexRating 3 out of 5The concept of M.M. Shelley's 'The Zombie Story' is original and creative. The world that the author creates is a fascinating place, filled with magic and of course zombies. All of this makes for a pretty cool read, especially for YA readers.The characters were fairly well rounded considering the novella length, and we weren't bogged down with countless pages of description which is a bonus for a novella. The range of characters, whilst fairly interesting individually, the way that they interacted was a little awkward and difficult. This was largely as result of the stilted and uncomfortable dialogue that was created.The book could do with a little editing tlc, and whilst it was a little distracting, I was still able to continue reading and enjoy the story. It was refreshing to read a YA not bogged down by romance. I'd happily recommend this to YA readers who are looking for a first introduction into the world of zombies.Disclosure: This ebook was a FREE download.",An enjoyable read.,1363564800,1,1
"Shiloh Walker is here to give the Brothers Grimm some competition. In her new series, Grimm's Circle, Walker creates a cool new world in which guardian angels are more human than ever before, and we get to see the truth behind the fairy tales.The first book in the series, ""Candy Houses"", tells the story of Greta and Rip. You've read about them before- Gretel of Hansel and Gretel fame, and Rip Van Winkle of the long, long nap- but never like this. They have both become Grimms, sort of combination paranormal-superhero-guardian angels. Their role is to protect people from monsters and demons. As Rip explains it, there must be balance; if there's evil there's also good, and visa versa.""Candy Houses"" is a novella, approximately 100 pages in .pdf form. I am the first to admit that I'm normally not a fan of short stories when it comes to romance or mysteries. Those are two genres that need time to develop in order to gain the realism or depth that makes them interesting. However, Shiloh Walker has converted me. The romance didn't feel rushed or fake; it was actually sweeter and more believable than many I've read. The writing was, as always, excellent, the plot engaging, and the characters well developed.There are thousands of fairy tales out there, and I don't doubt that fans will be clamoring to see Walker put her unique spin on their favorites.",The start of a great new series by Shiloh Walker,1269043200,3,3
"Today's review is on Angel Eyes by Quinteria RameyAngel Eyes is the final installment in the Forever Trilogy, and for me it fell a bit below the mark. There were numerous spelling and grammar errors through out the book, and was a bit anti-climatic.There was great build up to THE final battle where Ana would finally right the wrong's of her previous lives, but once you got there, there was little to zero action. And though I am a sucker for the happy ending, I think that perhaps the author's could have written it a bit better. It took far to many years for her to be reunited with Tristan, and to see her entire lives relived differently? That's just a little out there.I had had such high hopes for this last book and was let down.

Growing up was difficult until she was able to move away to a small town in Texas where she was thankful the people kept to themselves and out of her business.  These people in this town didn't pry or gossip and left her alone to live out her life in peace.

"Tia Jackson is the over-achieving still singleton of the five Jackson sisters. Her single spinster state is such an area of sensitivity for her that she routinely makes up imaginary boyfriends to keep her sisters off her back.Melvin Reed is a neighborhood florist. Blue collar, bad boy, dangerous background who has been hankering after Tia for years. She however has never even noticed him. Until she ropes him into playing along as her boyfriend for her youngest sisters' wedding because she truthfully can't produce her supposed real boyfriend.Not one to pass up a golden opportunity Mel enters into the deception, determined to make Ms. Jackson notice him finally.This was very cute and there were some nice laugh out loud moments.""Say that again?"""" I hooked you up."" Margie shrugged. ""I figured if you can't get it right, I'll have to do it for you.""""You have lost your mind.""She waved me off. ""You know Ben who bowls with Chuckie?""""Ben? Three-finger Ben?""Margie shoots me a look from over her shoulder. ""He's missing thumbs. The man has a disability, Tia. He has other fingers, though. And if he can still bowl atop 200 on average, that means he knows how to use what he got.""And I thought the jobs Tia gave her imaginary boyfriends (pilot, trucker, naval officer) were clever because it gave her good excuses to never produce them on demand.But overall this book was kinda all over the place. First it was told in duelling first persons by Tia and Mel. This wouldn't have been too bad if they each got alternating chapters, for instance, but the POV shifted between paragraphs sometimes so you really had to figure out who the 'I' was in the sentence.Second, I have come across many a book where a professional, grown, self-supporting, over-the-age-of-30-woman is treated like a child by overprotective man-folk. I am over that trope. Way over it. It is alive and well in this book. To be fair, Tia actually rejects it in the end using words very similar to my own above, but if I never see it rear it's head again in a book I'll be happy.And lastly, while I enjoyed Tia's big, rambunctious over the top family there were a few times some of them veered into the area of out-right caricature. Her oldest sister Margie who actually starts out the book as colorful and interesting, over the course of the story just became shrill and shrewish. I actually made a note that said at one point she 'sounded like a ghetto harpy.'All in all this was a fun book.

"First, I must say I am a huge fan of Aliyah Burke. I became hooked on Knights Vow and it is still one of my favorite interracial time-travel stories. I have only sampled this book but had to comment on the review ""NO WOW FACTOR"". I cannot agree or disagree with the story because I have not read it but I wanted to give kudos to the reviewer for finally mentioning something I have been too shy to admit but felt strongly. I also feel an interracial story should have some mention of race whether good or bad at some point in the story. I too have read hundreds of stories and am looking for that something 'different' that sets it apart from the regular romances I have read over the years. I don't have to have negative racial issues overshadowing characters or crude sad endings that are too realistic. Burke's Knight's Vow is a perfect example in my book. Even though the woman is a product of a mixed marriage, she clearly relates to being a black woman and we watch her go through her time-travel experiences, realistically not being accepted centuries before her time. I have read that same story line with a white heroine and although just as fun to read, this version made me say ""Yep, that's probably what would have happened to a woman of color back then"" but we get the yummy fantasy of snagging the hot guy in the process. Maybe some authors just want to paint the picture of interracial as the norm and that is why they do not mention it in some stories? I guess for me some of the best scenes are when characters recognize their differences and completely fall in love as if that enhanced their love not distracted from it.",interracial romance,1328572800,3,3

There is something so lovely and touching about this beautiful and meaningful story of two men who find each other and slowly, shyly take that fall into love.The story is written from Hunter's point of view, and gives us such insight into how he thinks.  All his fear, hopes, wants, needs.  And how utterly and solidly he is in love with and trembles for Max.And Max.  Such a vulnerable yet strong man.  He knows what he wants and even though he obviously loves Hunter, he isn't willing to settle for less than he wants and deserves.I found myself with a sense of quiet wonder reading this book.  It was like a spell was woven and I didn't want to wake up.  And it was such a sweet and loving dream too.This one is a classic.

"This is my least favorite of the Laurann Dohner series. I was disappointed in it. I'm not sure if I didn't like the individual story or the series premise. I do know that I did NOT like the main female character Mika. In fact, I couldn't stand her. In the story they kept talking about what Grady kept doing wriong, but seemed to ignore all the things Mika was doing or the fact that her strong and irrational reactions were making things worse. Mika's hot and cold swings were really annoying too. The female character is annoying and stupid; she almost gets gang raped and then repeats the same behavior and can't understand why she shouldn't have. I did like Grady's brothers so I'm going to give the next book a chance.",least fav Dohner series,1357430400,2,2

"I'm having trouble reading this, it is so silly.  For example, the lead character meets his new partner (female) in the morning, assigns her a boring reading detail, and later that night when he arrives at a scene where she has been an undercover decoy, says about her eyes, ""They were radiant, energetic brown pools.  Lately, they had been hypnotic and lingering.""  He has known this woman for about 12 hours at this point, and been apart from her for the past several.  There is no ""lately"" involved in this time frame!  How stupid!  For the life of me, I don't know how this book has gotten any good reviews; it is just awful.

"Indian Moon crept up on me.  Two disheartened people caught in the web of life each wonder how they got to where they are.  Quentin is struck by his young partner's willingness to take chances, to reach out to other people, to women no less.  Ralph leaves everyone in his wake smiling and feeling good about themselves, from the hostess in the local barbeque joint to the battle-axe receptionist who ends up giggling at the incorrigible young man. Ralph's antics remind Quentin how long it has been since he's felt joy and pride in his life much less caused it in others.Regina is caught in the ugly and dispiriting cycle of an abusive marriage. She stands as if at a distance watching the effects it has on herself and her two children. But she feels helpless to do anything but keep the simmering violence from escalating.When these two lost and dispirited people meet something happens that changes their lives and all of those around them.  They fall in love. But if love doesn't necessarily conquer all, in this case it forces the protagonists to wrestle with deep painful questions.  When did they begin letting others make critical decisions for them? When did they stop being honorable?  Stop asking what was important to them? What they wanted to do and to feel? And when did they begin to believe that nothing they did could make a difference in their lives or in others.This is a thoughtful, challenging story. After al,l it deals with the issues that make can either break or make a person. As Quentin and Regina tentatively explore their feelings for each other they are forced to deal with issues they have caused and ones that they have let happen. They learn that love is worth fighting for. Even more important, they learn that honor, dignity and being true to who they are is the greatest gift they can give to one another and to themselves.",Love is worth fighting for,1341014400,0,0
"I really enjoyed the first book ""In the Garden of Temptation"". It was well written and so enjoyable that I wanted to read the rest of the ""In the Garden"" books.  I did not enjoy this book at all.  Simon Fitzgerald, Marquess of Sutherland was not my idea of hero or romantic lead.  He is down right obnoxious. Simon is attracted to Cassandra James a wealthy merchants daughter mainly for her red hair. He starts out by grabbing a redheaded woman from behind and fondling her without even knowing who she is. This is done at a party for people to meet an author. He thinks she is a former lover. Well it turns out he is fondling Cassandra who of course is outraged and forms the everlasting opinion that Simon is a rake, a despoiler of women and not to be trusted, EVER.  Simon thinks Cassandra is fair game for seduction because she is not from the peerage (ton) and he can have his way with her and eventually toss her aside when he is done. That is his declared intention.Due to a mystery surrounding her birth, Cassandra finds out she is indeed from the peerage and is an earl's granddaughter. Well the story goes down hill from there. I did not like Cassandra at all. She did not seem to have people around her who loved her or took care of her (such as a maid or abigail) since her mother died.  Being wealthy you would expect that Cassandra would have a servant of long standing that took care of her and gave her motherly affection. Someone she could confide in and seek comfort and assistance from.  The grandfather is mean and controlling and threatens Cassandra and her father to get her to do what he wants. Cassandra was rude and abrasive to those around her because she was ""frightened"".  Frightened of Simon, frightened of her grandfather, frightened of her Cousin Roger.  Then one night after rebuffing Simon at every single turn, she gets drunk and throws herself at Simon, flirting and sitting on his lap in a public place (this from a girl who gets angry at Simon for his improper behavior towards her). Neither character was likable and I was frustrated with both of them. Simon and his arrogance and Cassandra for letting fear rule her life for one minute then she turns into a very forceful person at times. It was a big frustrating contradiction.  This story was a tiresome argument from the beginning to the end. I was not rooting for them to be together and I was not even appeased by the epilogue.  This was the most frustrating story I have ever read. I was so glad when it was over. I like Cynthia Wicklund's writing style, good editing and hope the next book is better.",Frustrating Read,1371168000,1,1

Someone please tell this person, as she has a great series but it has gotten lost in the maze.

"I found this books to be quite enjoyable. The main character was drawn quite well and seemed to be a real person, rather than some two-dimensional character. I liked the fact that unlike most fantasy heroines, she isn't a young miss. She is the mother of two teenaged sons and a devoted wife of some years. She had a history and a background upon which to draw from.In this book, her husband has gone missing. Rather than accept the inevitable, she gathers up her courage to go look for him. At no time does her personality undergo a radical change where she is suddenly in possession of unique fighting skills or magical power. Instead, she muddles through as best she can, much as anyone else would. I think that it is this touch of ""realism"" that helps to make the book. The events are low key and very believable - for a fantasy book.",A nice solid fantasy,1368489600,0,0

Also, I found the constant use of ""bleep"" (and its various forms) to be very annoying and doing so interrupted the flow of the story far more than the language itself would have. In addition, the book was too long, with way too many trivial details. On the other hand, the dialogue was crisp and often funny, the characterizations were excellent and the plot was original.

"My first introduction to this author was her Brotherhood of the Blood novels which are absolutely remarkable.  I think the things that turned off other readers was that the type of erotica in this book was unexpected.  Threesomes are more often in her writing than a monogamist relationship.  You have to have an open mind to truly get everything you can from her work.  I think with this novel you also need a healthy dose of imagination.  Don't read any of her work if you don't have open mind and definitely don't read this book if you don't have an imagination.

"My Soul to Lose is a novella set in the world of author Rachel Vincent's Soul Screamers series prior to the events that take place in the first full-length book in the series, My Soul to Take.Told from the perspective of the main character in the series, Kaylee Cavanaugh, it gives readers a short glimpse into her life prior to her discovery of who and what she is. In this story both readers and Kaylee are unaware of just what is wrong with her and why she has debilitating ""panic attacks"" that cause her to scream uncontrollably, to see things that shouldn't be there, and that leave her hoarse, terrified and questioning her sanity.And while the novella creates more questions than provides answers, it does introduce readers to Kaylee and gives them a look at a heroine who is in many ways a normal, frightened teenage girl who just wishes none of this was happening to her, but who is also strong and selfless and who manages to retain her sarcasm and sense of humor through it all.My Soul to Lose is an exciting and immensely entertaining introduction to this series. It develops the main character and teases the world enough for readers to want to know more. It gives readers a feel for the author's writing style and gives them a peek at several characters who will make an appearance in later books in the series.Whether the novella is read prior to having read any or all of the full-length books in the series or not, it will be captivating and intriguing, humorous and heartbreaking, a little bit shocking and most definitely eye-opening.While My Soul to Lose can be read at any point during the series, reading it prior to the first book offers a very different experience for readers than reading it at any point thereafter.

"The Jynx by K.C. Crowe is presented as a modern take on ""The Old Man and the Sea"".  While Billy's story has a different twist (as per the synopsis) the beginning just felt too darn familiar in texture to Hemingway's work.  This distracted me from fully appreciating Billy's own story.The flat storytelling, with its detailed focus on mundane matters, is one that I generally find interesting, as it highlights the author's skill as a writer and ability to engage to reader in the base-humanity of the lead character's life.  This author does a fine job of accomplishing that.A comment:~Of the first 15 sentences 12 began with they, he, Billy, Sweeney or the dog.  I usually don't notice stuff like this, but it was troubling to see this lack of diversity right off the bat.  It went away as the excerpt progressed, but was simply glaring in the beginning.I'm right on the fence as to whether I'd be interested in reading more of this book.

"A fast paced booklet to help you remove excess clutter from your home.The author, treating clutter as an addiction, jumps right to the point, and identifying 7 main kinds of clutter personalities.  Included are labels like the Paper Pusher, Decor Disaster Victim, and the Chronic Collector (just like the kind they make TV shows about).Right away, I feel left out.  Yes, I have clutter in my home that I want to get rid of, but I don't fit into any of these categories.  Feeling excluded, I continued to read the book to see if there was any useful tips I might be able to incorporate into my life.After reviewing reasons why we collect clutter and some reasons for avoiding an excess of stuff, the author examines several areas of the home and how to purge them of unnecessary things.  For me, the last chapter of the book, How to Maintain a Clutter-Free Home, was the most (possibly only) useful part of the book.  But again, the tips are quite obvious and difficult to incorporate into one's routine without external motivation.All in all, I wasn't very impressed with this booklet.

To be a Hunter is a huge honor and Gabe feels that Sarah will be ok waiting, as they always have their dreams.  Add to that he is concerned about the sexual demands he dreams of making on her and he thinks the time apart will help them both.  In fact, he befriends another shifter, Chloe, before he goes so that she will have someone to talk with about him being gone.  What he doesn't count on is that person not sharing the information with Sarah.Sarah can't believe it the one man who she knows she can love more than life itself deserts her.  And, just when she learns an important secret about herself.  Now it looks like her high and mighty Hunter has returned, and, by the greeting he gets at the local diner, she is convinced he has been making a fool out of her with another.  She takes his friendship with Chloe to be an affair.  So she sets out to flirt with a friend of hers to show him that two can play at that game.Now Gabe wants to claim Sarah but she is far from the loving mate that he left.  Even if he straightens things out will she forgive him?  Or will they only have their dreams?I am a HUGE fan of the Halle Pumas series but I have to say that Only in My Dreams is my least favorite in the series thus far.

"There were things I liked and didn't like about this book. Firstly, I loathe weak, weeping heroines that can't do anything for themselves. Bree does nothing but fall in the mud and kick her reluctant husband in the crotch for no reason. And he hates women. Why? You never find out. Because he was a man whore as a young man I guess. Ruan's evil half brother forces him to marry an ugly fat chick because the evil brother sells his 10 year old sister to their enemy in marriage. This never made sense. If he's your enemy why would he agree to marry a child? So to get the marriage annulled after rescuing his little sister Ruan somehow ends up married to Bree, who responds by scratching and kicking her new husband and trying to run away. At first I liked the little sister, Merry, but then she turned into a little brat who would kick her brother (who saved her life) at every chance because he was starting to care for his new wife. They struggle with their feelings for one another because she's a woman and thus not to be trusted, and he's a man, thus he's going to beat her.

"I was somewhat disappointed.  The plot is pretty typical - young woman and little brother left alone on a ranch, rich guy and beautiful daughter want to take said ranch from her, bad guys try to force her to sell, hero comes along and saves the day.  It could have been a good story but too much time and emphasis was placed on descriptive love scenes that eventually almost took away from the story.  A book should tell the story, ensnare the reader, and get the point across without having to describe every little detail of who did what to whom.  Even in the epilogue there was such a scene.  Would have been classier if some of that had been left out.  This was a book I read on my Kindle.

"The blurb for this series says...""The `Zombie Chronicles' universe, where the zombies don't stay mindless, shambling adversaries. Instead they grow smarter, faster and stronger as they feed on the flesh of the living.""...and to that statement I would add, ""And where zombie-fighting humans begin to suspect that they, too, are changing as they struggle to survive in this bleak world.""Author Mark Clodi distinguished The Zombie Chronicles by coming up with the very novel idea that Romero-type zombies could learn and grow as they feed.  The human survivors in the Zombie Chronicles world therefore have to content with both types of zombies as they try to survive.The first three Zombie Chronicles books center upon Max, his best friend Bill, a cop Jane Steward, and a great supporting cast of minor characters -- both human and zombie.  Interesting questions are raised:  Can a thinking zombie still care about humanity?  Could zombie and human work together to overcome the common evil?  What qualifies as humanity?  There are some grammatical mistakes in the series, particularly in the first book, but for me those faded in significance as I was caught up in the unique ""smart zombies"" premise, the multidimensional characters (it was particularly interesting to see the world through the eyes of the smart zombies), and the action as Max and friends try to stay alive.In book one, Outbreak, Max meets his first zombie at the office, and fights his way home to his family.","Good story, interesting ""smart zombie"" concept",1311120000,2,2

"It's an oldie but a goodie. That's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception. While the original publication goes back to 1864, it is a fun romp nonetheless. It should be noted that, over the years, different translations of the book have been made. This version from Amazon comes at the low, low cost of free. One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed. But these things are trivial, as the story of a professor, his nephew, and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good: There were a few things I really liked about this book. First, the adventure. The excursion into the unknown was fascinating. Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is. You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things. Also, I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual, educational account. Throughout the entirety of the book, the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience. It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth!The Bad: One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing. There are many words and phrases used that we just don't use today. At times, I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about. For instance, on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have ""repast"". This isn't a term most would use today, and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal. Also, the pacing in the beginning is a little slow, and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly: This one is not really a fault of the book, after all, I have to take the time period it was written in into account. This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry. The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies. Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey, all of what they see is plausible for the time period written. Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks, the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past, thousands of years before their journey. All of it, in a sense, was real at one point. Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth's history, and fantastical things that it will probably never see either. If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film, you may be disappointed.Overall, I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago.

"This story has a lot of history of India.  An Indian doctor is practicing in a small English town.  His mother is married to an Englishman.  He meets his English rose and the plot picks up.  His standards are very high and he practices great control until they marry.  She is a little ""damaged"" by past events in her family but he gets her through all of that.  It is a good story line but I got a little tired of all the negative events and their inability to do anything about it but sit and wait for everyone to become enlightened and see how wonderful they truly are.  It was an interesting read for the most part but I found a lot of the characters a little hard to believe.  So many bad guys in one family!!",GOOD STORY,1348185600,0,0
"I needed an evening of relaxed reading, settling in with an old friend whose story I'd already heard, so I picked up Louis L'Amour's Brionne.  L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.",Brionne,1370908800,0,0

Not nearly as weirdly entertaining as the first book at all. The only thing that made me give this book an extra star from the single one it probably deserved was that Belvill did keep on guessing who the real culprit was until the very end.

"I can see from the other reviews that I am in the minority here, but this book just didn't measure up for me. There are a couple of things that I look for in a book. It has to have either a believable plot, characters that I came to know and care about, or some twist that I didn't see coming. This book didn't have any of those for me. It felt like the author spent 5 or so pages pulling together the ending. I think that when you finally find out ""whodunit"", you should be able to go back and see where the author left the clues that you didn't see. At the end of this one, there were too many things that seemed to be added to make it all come together. But the biggest problem for me was that, at the end of the book, I didn't feel as though I knew anything about the characters.

There was no meat to any of these stories.  It was like the author thought ""I have a great idea for a horror story.  I wonder how few sentences I can write it in.""  I realized these are supposed to be short stories, but they read more like synopses of novel ideas.  The concept of the first story was intriguing, but thrown at the reader so quickly and summarily that you don't have time to get invested in the story.  The last story, about knick knacks was the only one that really worked well as a short story.I'm tempted to say that I'd be interested in reading a full length story from the author (Scribner), but I don't think I actually would.  Every single character was the same.  There was no personality to any of them that distinguished any one of them from another.Again, the grammar was fantastic, and it's rare that I compliment someone's grammar, so if that's all you really care about, then this book is for you.In summary, the book was free, so I can't complain about the cost or ask for my money back, but I if possible, I would ask for the fifteen minutes back that I spent reading it.","Short on Horror, long on Crap",1313020800,4,4

When a family is torn apart because of a mother's poor judgment...separation, cruelty, despair, and memories are all these children are left with.  This is an intense storyline that many children have lived, are living, or will live.  I commend the author for showing cause and effect...actions -vs- reactions with family members.  The dialogue and emotions were very vivid, genuine and lucid yet the design of the details proved to be its undoing.

"I've waded through the whole series before commenting.First the good:Lalonde has some interesting ideas, creates characters one can care about, and in many ways spins a good yarn.  As with much classic sci-fi, we must suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the yarn. I therefore didn't ding him very much for the inconsistencies others have noted.Now the bad:Even with Broadcast 6, Lalonde's writing remains a major distraction. He often uses words that don't mean what he thinks they mean. Many of his sentences are run-ons or fragments. Too many are almost (or are completely) unintelligible.  He doesn't seem to know the differences between ""were"" and ""was,"" ""they're"" and ""their,"" ""its"" and ""it's,"" ""whose"" and ""who's"" or ""affect"" and ""effect.""  He consistently drops clunkers like ""her and Laura,"" ""her and her mother,"" and (unforgivably, since I don't think there's ever a place for) ""her and I.""  It's just sloppy writing, and makes it hard to appreciate the story line.  His poor punctuation makes it worse.While the books are inexpensive, I'd suggest that Lalonde hire a good editor even if it adds to the retail price.  Unless that happens, I doubt I'll be reading any more of his work.",Still needs a good editor,1306108800,7,7

I liked how the heroine had to come around and decide if she was a one-man-womanor she could love both equally. And the MEN, my sweet jesus, where they hot! And surprisingly emotional.

"I read this probably back in August or September. I review nearly everything I read, but I just didn't have any enthusiasm for this one, any drive to talk about it. The good news is that it's a cheap read, and so if the topic interests you then you won't be losing much in the gamble. Perhaps it's a matter of this story being all too familiar, and so the stark recitation of facts just doesn't seem like more than you'd get in a newspaper story. At this point, I don't need to be convinced that the Catholic Church, for all of its positive qualities, has allowed their children to be devastated while shuffling the abusers around and hiding them. Now, I want to make sense of it all.Father Bernard Bissonnette becomes more cliche than man as he pretty much hit every stereotype as he was allowed to abuse children for decades. A family seeks to confront him about it, and the beginning of the book promises this will happen. At the end we find out that he is pretty unrepentant, but so old and sickly that he is a pitiable figure. No one gets closure. The lack of closure for the reader is nothing compared to the lack of closure for these families. However, I'm left wondering what it all means and what the future seems to hold. Where is the context and how does this fit in with the bigger picture? Since the details, tragically, follow a familiar pattern, what does this piece offer?I've I'd read this story years ago, it perhaps would have been enough in it's current form. The tale is no longer a new one, and even as the details should be shocking they've become too familiar. What are the answers? How is the church apt to change to respond to this? We live in a time when the word ""priest"" is said, and people have to will themselves not to snicker -- even people who were raised Catholic. What now?",Didn't Stick With Me -- And It Should Have,1324771200,10,10

"From the title, I visualized a quasi-medieval fantasy of four brothers, like knights, riding forth to engage the enemy.  The Order, instead, is an organization of many men and women of various talents and expertise whose teams, aided by the gods, fight to contain The Thing that brought evil to the world.Some readers don't like prologues, but I was immediately caught up and found the book hard to put down.  The prologue tells how evil appeared and gave rise to the Starry Wisdom, worshippers of this evil.  Priests founded the Order of the Four Sons to fight the Starry Wisdom.The adventure begins in a shroud of mystery that grips the reader, like a Dan Brown religious thriller.  Someone cries out for help.In the softness of time we see the evil's effects, down to the present.  Children disappear and so do teams of the Order of the Four Sons.  As the crisis grows, we get a lot of names thrown at us, but most of these resolve into unique characters with memorable personalities--a retired marine, a burnt out ex detective, an old man, two technology geeks, and a trainee of unknown but surprising talents.  Garnette, Murphy, Doug, Cecil, Bill, and Kate comprise the last team to be formed, incomplete and ill prepared.  And we love them, for the writers manage them like a master.  Without delving into character backgrounds, we quickly sense that they are solidly human.  And we delight in their witty exchanges, a gallows humor that helps them maintain a mental balance throughout the demonic warfare.They battle Lady Bathory, more monster than lady, and her cohorts, who seek a magic wand that will stabilize a gate between worlds so she can expand her territory.  The team of the Order must find the wand first.  The quest becomes a spiritual treasure hunt as one clue leads to another.Much of the writing is impeccable, but questions arise, not all of which are answered to the reader's satisfaction.  Sure, I can figure out some.  But I suspect that some answers won't be forthcoming in Book Two.  For example, a federal organization called MJ-12 gets involved, and I'm wondering, Who are these guys?  Why are they attacking the team?  Also, more names than necessary are mentioned.  The characters have more than one name; some have several.  Ordinarily this caused the reader no problem, but I suffered some confusion, particularly over who the Blood Lady is and belatedly realized she is imprisoned in a bubble.The story ends in a cliff hanger.  Questions dangle.  We can expect answers to most in Book Two of the series.  But not all--and that's what bothers me.  In essence the Oracle tells us to stay tuned for the further adventures of our team.  The read is entertaining, so grab your next copy.",A Paranormal Thriller,1375142400,0,0

"What a basically ""blah"" story. Neither of the characters are especially interesting, the violence isn't at all effective (and of questionable reality in certain areas), there's no motivation for what's going on and basically just not much here to like.This story perpetuates one of the great myths of serial killers; that they love doing what they do and will snicker about how gloriously EVIL they are while doing it. We have two serial killers who like doing their thing through the medium of hitchhiking; one as a driver and the other as a passenger. When they meet up, it's like ""Frankenstein vs the Wolfman"", only even less interesting. I also find it vaguely amusing that the violence is quite graphic, but the sexual content is glossed over quickly, as per the usual for American audiences.There's some real potential here as a plot idea, but the execution, as it were, is terrible.

Normally, I'm not a great fan of the ""tell"" style of writing, but as this story is actually portraying one side of a conversation, it's entirely appropriate.This story does, indeed, chronicle the lifespan of the narrator's breasts, from their sudden emergence to their ""betrayal"". There's a good dose of humour, both black and blue, and I found the emotional content appropriate and touching. The breasts themselves act almost as a character, and the narrator allows them to be both a physical and emotional barrier whenever she feels overwhelmed. The loss of such a big part (literally and metaphorically) of her lifestyle is handled with a cracked bravado that Ms. Brio conveys very well.This story is probably not for everyone, of course. As I said in the title to this review, it's a sweet story from an emotional aspect. But it has a hard edge to its bones.

Consequently, I am aware that the murder and the resolution to said murder had to happen a bit more quickly than in a novel...I did not realize that it would be a 10 minute discovery. You can read his resolution in REAL TIME. What is the fun in that? Why isn't inspector Zhang everywhere then? Where's his cape? Or pipe, in this case being more apropos?  Even Sherlock knew how to entertain, and he too, was a bit of a jerk.What really bugged me about this story was all of the superfluous descriptions...like for example: in Zhang's mind there are 7 ways to deduce a ""closed door mystery"",  which he listed ALL seven (OUTLOUD) even if they did not make ANY sense...EVENTHOUGH HE KNEW WHO DID IT.Hence my original assessment, that Zhang is a pretentious individual. Couple my dislike for him with the ease and simplicity of the type of murder (a case this character has waited his WHOLE LIFE for, only to solve it in 10 minutes) and it results in a ""two star"" rating.I have not read anything else with the character in it, nor am I familiar with this author.

This one did not get me. I enjoyed the beginning , maybe the first 4 chapters then it just sank into a maize of chit chat that didn't really make much of a difference to the reader.Sorry ...... I just cant write anything positive about it. J Randall may want to catch my attention by taking me all over the globe with the nonsense and very predictable plot, but it just didn't get my curiosity going. I was looking forward to finishing the book so I can move on to another book.","Gamal's Assassin , my thoughts",1313193600,1,1
"This was the first book that I read by Lissa Matthews and overall I enjoyed it.The scenes between Aidn and Bailey were hot and as a ""curvy"" woman, I was able to relate to Bailey throughout the story.Like other reviewers have mentioned, the story ended too soon (which is why only 4 stars).  It would have been great to have seen more development of the relationship of Aidn and Bailey both in and out of bed.

"Ava Sweet has had a crush on her best friend's brother since high school.  After overhearing him discussing her in less than flattering terms she vows to prove to him that she's perfectly capable of being womanly - and not just `Dr. Doolittle' in baggy, ugly clothes.Luke McGiffin isn't oblivious to Ava's charms despite his attempts at denying them to his friend Pete.  The last thing he expected was for her to overhear their discussion or for Ava to lay a lip lock on Pete and demand a date that Friday night.Ava's always been shy and worn clothes that downplay her form, but Luke's oblivious attitude calls for a serious makeover and her friend Jen is more than happy to help.  Ava hopes the date will serve a dual purpose - bring her friend and Pete together and finally entice Luke to make a move on her.  The evening before her date with Pete, Ava receives a phone call from Luke that has her questioning if her plan is already working.Despite Luke's vow to do physical harm to Pete if he so much as touches her Ava and Pete continue with their plans for the evening but is Ava truly prepared for the reaction she'll receive once she's all dolled up and incites his jealousy.  Luke's a man with a strong sexual appetite and he's done his best for years to keep his desire for Ava at bay.  Is she prepared to handle his unleashed passionate nature?FORBIDDEN FRUIT is a simply delightful read that will have readers smiling their way through the antics of all the characters.  I couldn't help but laugh at Ava's reaction to Luke's thoughtless comments and how she goes about getting his attention.  I loved the realistic feel to this story and the friendship that's so apparent between Luke, Ava, Pete and Jen.  Anne Rainey charms her way into readers' hearts with flawed characters and situations that excite as much as they delight.  As if that's not enough for you to thoroughly enjoy this story, the red-hot smoldering tension and Luke's alpha personality will give you plenty of reasons to salivate.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",Will the FORBIDDEN FRUIT be as delectable as Ava hopes?,1224979200,4,4

Maia Underwood breathes new life into the Romance genre with her tale of Selena and Dan. The world building was realistic and tangible.

"Veronica Camille Tinto, born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago but now living in Texas,  has published her first book A JOURNEY INTO TOMORROW and informs the reader in a very tender way that 'Writing these poems began as a therapeutic process which turned into words that supported me during a very tumultuous period in my life.'  Books such as this, presented with a beautiful cover of a sunset over water, plead credence, and while the thoughts on the pages of this collection are touching, if somewhat nave, they are truly short meditations and not poems.  The term 'poem' is defined as '1) A verbal composition designed to convey experiences, ideas, or emotions in a vivid and imaginative way, characterized by the use of language chosen for its sound and suggestive power and by the use of literary techniques such as meter, metaphor, and rhyme. 2) A composition in verse rather than in prose. And 3) A literary composition written with an intensity or beauty of language more characteristic of poetry than of prose.'  Tinto's writing is simply outside these guidelines.An example of Tinto's work follows:READY FOR THE CALLAre we ready for the call?Do we have all out emotional business in order?Do we tell people that mean the most how we feel?Do we say love...show love...and mean love?Then can we truly say hear [sic] I am...it is I...and I am readyfor the callThere is honesty of emotion here and a sharing of life experiences that this diary marks as a woman overcomes the struggles she encounters as well as the discoveries of joy she finds.  And doubtless there will be readers who connect with her brief messages. But even given the broad parameters of how poetry is written today, Tinto's words do not fall into the realm of poetry.  And that is fine.  Is the book worth reading? Yes, any source of solace that is available to people who need to connect with fellow travelers is worthy of publication.

I felt like her relationships and the falling outs that she had were easy to relate but I didn't like that she want from man to man and that when she finally finds the man she falls in love with we don't get to see their relationship at all, we just get to see the relationships with all the wrong guys.

"I am hooked on the Toleffson men and on this series that Meg Benjamin has created. After two visit to small town Konigsburg, I am back for a third time and this times it's Lars Toleffson turn in front of cupids arrow.Lars has not had it easy, with a litany of what if's in his past he is trying to build a new life for himself and his daughter - it's going well enough and could go better if he could find a sitter for his two years old, who was more interested in the child than in him or has some sense of health and safety.When he places an advert and Jessamyn Carroll turns up for the job, she does not look like a babysitter, but at this stage he was just about ready to try anything. Things goes better than he would have ever imagined and just when he thinks that the only thing he has left to worry about is his sisters-in-law trying to match make, someone tries to takes Jack the babysitters son. Lars sees only one alternative at hand - move in and take onboard Jess's battles.Jessamyn Carroll is working a job she doesn't particularly like but it allows for her to have a roof over her head and most importantly let her continue living under the radar.She needs this cover to hide from her in-laws and give her son every chance of normalcy as she can. When danger comes a calling Jess is place into a not so reluctant position of accepting help from Lars Toleffson.Jesse and Lars are not equipped to deal with all these challenges on their own and needs the help of all the Toleffson brood. Getting them involved only help them to a certain degree because Lars is sweet on Jess and Jess is most definitely sweet and Lars - but with Docia Toleffson and a precocious two years old to content with - Maybe meeting all those challenges head on did not seem so bad after all.Meg Benjamin and her Konigsburg series is another wonderful find for me this year. Third book in the series BE MY BABY is not only a wonderful addition but it is the best book of the series so far.The other two feels like a build up to this book. Firstly there are the characters While I only just met Jess, Ms. Benjamin gave me enough of a background on her to identify with her, to understand where she was coming from. Larson on the other hand is firmly in my heart - I have been through, the entire range of emotion with him through two books - so I was ready for a happily ever after for him.The regulars made an appearance as well and no visit to Konigsburg would be complete without the shenanigans that the residents are famous for happening, so I met the very butch waitress, got involved in a proposal gone wrong and a battle of the dogs that I can only guess at who won.The meat of this book centers on Jess past trying to catch up with her - the characters involved in those scenes of the book were really well done...I was trapped in this plot. It moved fast, the twist and turns kept coming and faceless and chilly mannerism took on a whole new meaning. The way the author swings between the scenes like a revolving door really was one of the highlights of the book. imageThe who done it also sneaked up on me and even now I am so impressed at how well Ms. Benjamin wove the mystery into the other storylines to the point that I was just as surprised at everyone in Konigsburg about the outcome.Another positive was how the author grew the Toleffson boys, they are totally different in their approach and their thought process from how I met them earlier this year, That said there is one more single brother left and if there was  anyone more deserving of a HEA it is Erik Toleffson - I eagerly await his story .....Bottom LineSmall town does not get much better, more convoluted nor more up in the air than Konigsburg. BE MY BABY is a solid read and in my opinion a better book than the past two in the series. While there is a mystery to content with in this book, the characters are better defined; they are more relaxed, it feels like Ms. Benjamin is more comfortable with her creations.I am loving the fresh blood she introduces to the town, because left up to their own device's Konigsburgers would not allow anyone to cross its boundaries.I absolutely love this book and although it can be read on it's own I wouldn't recommend it - it would be your loss to miss out on meeting a fantastic and dynamic set of people.

"May be spoilers!I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for my review.This story starts out like most vampire stories telling in the first person the way one such ""vampire kid"" prepares himself to go out and hunt.  That is pretty much where it takes a different turn.  He feeds on a female and then passes out. He wakes to find he is being arrested and then things just get way wacky from there.  There are a lot of different perspectives: the cops, the vampires, the news crew, and of course the government.There is also a werewolf, so that is also a plus.The plot is a funny one because the vampires want to know who the oldest vampire is so Vlad, the main character and also the son of Count Dracula, rally the younger vampires together and they get a crime scene lab to test the different bloods of the Elder vampires.This story is meant to be funny and I have taken it as that.  There are a lot of mistakes in the copy that I received  .  I usually try to look over this because as long as the story is good than the grammar doesn't bother me as bad, but it was very hard with this book.

"I have been waiting to give my review on this book, a lot to say. First off this was a rather lengthy read, not a bad thing but longer then most I read.I want to say I like the book, and that I plan on reading the second for a couple reasons. I loved William, he was such a perfect character, he was created in a way that just oozed perfect man. And not in an overly sappy way, well some times I felt it was overly sappy but it still worked.The writing was amazing in many ways, I saw everything just how the author wanted me to see it, every push off the wall, I felt the love between the two characters.The relationship between William and Brynn was great, I liked the slow build from her not liking him at all to full on crush to love.My biggest issue was how quickly parts of the story happened, I was almost shocked and then thrown into another situation so quickly I wanted to stop reading, but I kept on because this author is a great one. Once I got passed the change I learned to live with it, and then I found myself enjoying this new situation that was happening, all in all it was a good story, I really did enjoy it. I give it a three because I was so into the characters I felt that I was really teased all the way till the end, and instead of getting any kind of outcome I just got left with unanswered questions that I have to wait yet again to see what happens. I would have liked a little bit of resolve before it ended, but I'm sure it was laid out this way on purpose. I really hope for the best but I really don't know what will happen.

"Even from the beginning, it was obvious to me how much research had been put in to this book and the way the story is told.  You don't need to have read the comments at the beginning in order to discover this.  The book also isn't the typical story of life in the camps and the focus isn't entirely on a couple torn apart by the events in a Nazi occupied area.  The book is about the couple, that is true, but the focus is more on the change of mindset of the average citizen.  Power is shifting in the government, people are starting to talk and believe what they hear.  Prejudice is growing and that changes things.I also found the descriptions as moving as the events themselves and they continued evenly throughout the story, adding to what was being spoken, thought, or described.

"it's hard to classify this book..it's not really horror although there are some ghostly and supernatural elements...I guess a grouping of supernatural short stories?

But the story is really about being different, wanting to fit in, and what happens when people just want to stick with the status quo...a surprisingly human story considering the focus is on a vampire...Thirst, The Night the Wind Died, Luminosity and the Boy Who Saw Fire--these are about the 'makers' I mentioned before..each one focuses on a different young boy or girl who are burdened with making, essentially, the world go aroundInvisible Friends and In the Heart of November--Two related stories about a girl and an imaginary friend...but she's not imaginary..she's a ghost...this isn't a horror story though..it's about friendship..All the stories were entertaining but I found these to be among my favorites.

"Let me be frank up front.  I am a Christian with all that implies.  Yet I did not like this book and I am not sure I am going to ever read another book by this artist.  From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like ""Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it.""  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say ""these tactics are not working?""  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.  Anything by Bill Myers makes this guy look worse than amateurish, though his Charismatic leanings come through pretty strongly.  Look, just find something else to buy.  This book isn't worth the effort.","Mr. Somers, you need an editor...",1319760000,2,2

He spent more than 10 years in the Army and now just wants to retire and manage one of the family estates, or someone else's.  He foolishly takes on a bet to get Lady Natalia to dance two dances in one evening with him.  He feels that with his charm it will be one way that he can finally get some funds.  He doesn't count on being rebuked by the lady and then charmed by her whole being.Lady Natalia Sinclair is the only child of the Duke of Clayton and therefore has a huge dowry.  She knows that is why many of the `ton' are seeking her out for marriage.  She wants to be loved for herself and not her funds.  She has always been intrigued by Captain Blake and the moment she sees him she wants to talk to him.  She initially is standoffish after meeting him, as his eyes looked as dead as every other fortune seeker, but is won over by his charms.Will everything be ruined by one indiscretion?  Will they be able to buck society and be together and find the love they both crave?I thoroughly enjoyed The Wager.  I read book one in the series before book two and I missed some of the suspense that the story intended.  As a stand along book it is wonderful, but don't make my mistake and read book two before book one.  The author does a wonderful job of keeping true to the storyline and characters.  Many series books seem to lose some of their continuity but this one was `spot on'.

I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it. This is a story of a woman who has had one rough stretch of luck and ends up in jail waiting several weeks before she even gets an arraignment. I'm not sure what the point of the book was and the ending left much to be desired. Too many questions were left unanswered. I wasn't crazy about the book while I was reading it but wanted to finish it since I was waiting for something to happen and the conflicts to be resolved. Neither of these occurred.

"Dee crafts a tale full of excitement, adventure, and love with ""Dawn of a Viking Sunrise."" Rosie Chan and her cousin, Singlee, are accidently sent back through time, but after being stranded in the past, will they still want to go back to their time in 2009 San Francisco?Dee's writing grabs the reader's attention immediately and doesn't let go. The plot moves fast and transitions well.The characters are compelling. Rosie has been spoiled her whole life, and when she's kidnapped, she learns what it means to be truly humble and thankful for the gifts in her life. Davyn also has some things to learn. When he finds his wife half starved to death in a neighboring Laird's dungeon, he pushes aside his ""alpha"" personality to give her what she needs to survive. Singlee also has to face his problems. He doesn't take things as seriously as he should. How these characters grow are a delight to the reader.Dee's descriptions are vivid using a good economy of words.

The three separate storylines are confusing at times, and it's just unbelievable that all three young women have men dripping off them.

If I had bought the books seperately at a standard price I might be inclined to give them 3.5 stars if it was available.Over all the story line in these books was pretty good.  The third book was a bit of a departure from the first two with a whole different plot line going on but it was still well worth the read.The books have an interesting array of characters with completely different cultural and physical aspects which I found interesting.  The story is mostly limited to the city of Elantra with some areas, or fiefs, technically in the city but ruled by other various outcasts or fief lords that even the king wouldn't bother trying to dislodge. We also get hints that these fief lords in fact serve a purpose to protect certain old magic in those areas. I would like to see further development of some stories that include characters from other fiefs besides Nightshade and maybe inclusion or further development of stories based on the old magic contained in some of those fiefs.Some of the main characters, while not overly complex, caught my interest (Nightshade, Sanabalis) and I hope we get more of them in the future.  The emperor we hear about and I assume we'll meet him the future.Unfortunately the main character of the book, Kaylin, just comes across as developmentally disabled.  She's been with the Hawks (a law enforcement group) since she was a child and was basically raised around them.  Although, she admits she failed every class given unless it was, by her definition, practical (IE: weapons, fighting, law, Barrani Language), how could she not pick up many of the cultural or political terms and situations just by being around the people.  She continually asks stupid questions that any normal person raised in that atmosphere would know.  Of course everyone just looks at her like she's retarded and refuses to answer her questions... so she's stupid and you just keep her stupid.  It basically came down to an overdone character type of her being the ""bruised and abused good hearted innocent hero, that basically saves the day by luck.""Apart from that I got sort of tired of hearing about her being broke, needing food, and hating magic and refusing to learn because it's not useful to her... yeah magic would neeeeveeer help you out of a tight situation when you're in danger.

There is a history interwoven in the form of a story-within-a-story, which itself is fascinating, but which also holds crucial elements of the main story.

"This novel had a unique plot line and a lot of promise, but as I got further into it I found I agreed with those that said there was just too much praying going on.  It seemed disruptive of the story line at times. I am a practicing Christian, and I don't mind a Christian-based novel once in awhile, although I have to be in the right mood for it. However, the praying and references to Jesus, salvation, and all the rest can be overdone at times and I think this is a good example of that.I also found it repetitive, and found myself skimming through some of the scenes that had already been done. Like how many times did we need to go out with Livy in the middle of the night and look for street kids, with the same result? This takes place in the Chicago area in the late 1800's and revolves around the fact that many young homeless children were exploited and abused.

Now they are aware of her and want to kill her. When she meets Valentine again, he is her executioner, but he decides to save her instead and takes her away before the head of his family can kill her.There are strict rules within the vampire families and somewhat of a caste system for the hiearchy of vampires in all the families.

"This is a short review, for a solid and decent book in the very fun PsyCop series. If you haven't read any book in this series yet, please check out my reviews of the first two books in this series Among the Living and Criss Cross.  I am a fan of Jordan Castillo Price's and of this series, but this book was just good -- not great; however, it is good and it is worth the read.  It felt like a bridge book, but having read further on in the series I can say that key things do happen in this book that are important.JCP is great about pushing the line in her urban fantasy world.  Ever wonder if lost limbs leave ghostly trails?  If a person has lost a hand, or a leg -- will its former limb appear as a ghost?  JCP answers that question in this book in a gruesome yet funny scene in which Vic is meeting Jacob's family for the first time.  In addition to the stress of attempting to impress his boyfriend's family, Vic is not using his prescription meds to dull his psychic senses (which the poor guy desparately relies on) and thus has to ignore the ghostly limb, while attempting to be coherent and friendly to his boyfriend's family -- all while sober.""I avoided looking at the spot where Leon's arm was flopping around on the table.""And as Vic laments to Jacob (after Vic flees the scene),""I am trying hard to be a decent boyfriend but I think I might not be cut out for it.""Body and Soul brings Vic and Jacob closer together.  With the typical introspective but witty inner dialogue that Vic employs, the reader is treated to Vic and Jacob's developing relationship.There is a decent mystery storyline and a cop investigation that is horror filled and gruesome.  This book is a fun and quick read.  Like the previous two books in the series, there is something about it that encourages compulsive behavior and I was not able to put it down -- I had to immediately go on to the next in the series.  But despite the addicting effect, Body and Soul is not the best book in the series, it is not great but it is good.  You will not be sorry you read it and you will learn some important things about Vic and Jacob together as a couple.  Body and Soul leads straight in to the fourth book in the series -- Secrets, which in my opinion is the best book thus far in PsyCop.",Solid Read; Good Entry in the Series,1327795200,3,3

For instance, there's a murky character named Buck who appears somewhere near the beginning of the book.  Even the author doesn't seem to know what to do with him and quickly gives him the axe.This novel screams out for a strong editor.

"The plot has some obvious holes in it, but Minger manages to keep the intrigue high by not revealing the twin's ruse until almost the end of the book. After Minger gets away from her over use of interior monologue and sometimes simplistic writing, the novel moves along at an even pace. One thing the author does well is descriptions, so anyone who likes to read detailed descriptions of a scene will appreciate Minger's skill.I kept waiting for the ruse to be revealed so see Hakon's reaction to his treatment of Gwendolyn, but, alas, the plot was not written that way. Like another reviewer said, the beginning seemed like it would be a novel about Anora and Wulfgard, but I think the author made a wise choice in focusing the novel on Hakon and Gwendolyn. Anora was too passive a character, too shy, too timid, too reliant on Gwendolwyn, who at first was too selfish and childish. Wulgard and Hakon are passionate warriors and hero and heroine are well matched in this novel.I have not read a medieval novel in ages and this one was quite enjoyable.",A well matched pair of lovers,1352592000,2,2

Towards the end the pace picked up as well as my understanding of the game that was being played out. I would have preferred if the author had let readers in on a few secrets early in the book.

They were worth the ebook price, but wouldn't be worth a regular paperback price.The setup was a little contrived, I expect some type of divine intervention explanation to cover why the earthquakes struck the military bases just when everyone went underground.The dialogue really is stilted, the author ought to record his daily conversations and compare them to dialogue in the book.  The characters talk like they were briefing a very picky 4 star general, not talking to friends.Some of the plot lines rely too much on coincidence.There are a lot of other negatives, but so what.This isn't great literature, but it's fun.

"The elements of this story showed off the the author's individual flare.  Rather than a run-of-the-mill nonhuman romance, she creates a cool world where shifters practice magic and potion-making and the rules of shifter society create real conflict for the hero, Lucas.  The heroine, Nita, has a lot of depth; she deals with avoiding life by sticking to her routine, something a lot people are guilty of.  Lucas makes some errors in judgment that have real consequences and those errors make him a plausible character.The love scenes aren't terribly memorable and the villain is dull, trite, and unworthy of the main characters.

"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).",Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story,1285286400,1,1

One moment she is in love with her boyfriend, a guy she's been knowing 5 years, the next she is entranced by the new guy at school (you guessed it... a vampire) and completely blowing her boyfriend off.My biggest problem with this book was the prologue because the author had the audacity to target the famous vampires Dracula, Lestat, and Edward as being 'wrong' yet not have the skills to back up this notion and provide a good novel.

"While running a bookstore she inherited from her grandmother, Amy meets Henry, and older man who thinks Amy looks much like his former flame.  Henry introduces Amy to his family, including the handsome, single Jake.  Amy and Jake have instant chemistry, but Amy has a boyfriend.  They agree to be friends, but Amy soon realizes her feelings run deeper.  However, due to a shocking family secret, Amy may never get the chance to have a deeper relationship with Jake.A Secret in the Attic is a charming, cute novella.  The story is a contemporary romance, and the relationship between Amy and Jake is touching and develops beautifully.  It is easy to relate to Amy, a woman stuck in a routine relationship.  The plot twists are exciting and unexpected.  However, I felt that the last third or so of the novella was not as developed as the beginning.  The development between Amy and Jake was detailed, as was the setting.  Once Amy uncovers the family secret, the story felt a bit rushed.  However, I did enjoy the story.  The conclusion was very sweet, and very touching.A Secret in the Attic was a good, quick read.  I would read more by the author, Samantha Jillian Bayarr, in the future.  At this 99 cent price, A Secret in the Attic is a great deal.",Charming contemporary novella,1309564800,4,4

"The first two books were so good and I couldn't put them down so I bought the third. And was very much let down. The writing while good left much lacking. The book focused on other characters that I was not attached to and the ending seems like it was written to simply halt things. No look into the future or anything simply destroyed the hope for love conquering all things. True love was ripped apart and Zoe ends up settling and working at being happy. In a book such as this one expects grander things,miracles, and wonder to happen. This book was predictable and a letdown. If you are someone who likes to read happy endings and likes closure stop at book 2.I am saddened at the abrupt end to the story and saddened that love was defeated and failed in mortality without a glimpse into the future.

"Being a fan of Heather's, I have read all of her current books, and there has not been a single one I have been disappointed with, or haven't liked. I really love Heather's style of writing, and one of the best things I like, is that if you think you know everything about a character, you had better think again, because the good guys aren't always good, and the bad guys are never really that bad. In the Chosen Soul, you will find a great storyline (to be continued in Book 2, Drake of Tanith), characters with so many layers it would put an onion to shame, gods, elves, demons, humans, orks and more, and realms that are brought to life in such a way as to imagine yourself standing in the Ice Realm of Caina itself. In this book I love the depth of each of the characters, as they learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and following each of them in their journey of self discovery, as they overcome many trials, to become the people they were destined to be.

"Eighteen year old Jason Ramsey is a geek. He's cute but invisible, especially to the girl he's been crushing on for years - beautiful, popular, cheerleader Becky Johnson. Then one day he saves an old man from nearly getting run over by a truck. The strange old man is an oddball and decides that Jason should be rewarded for his act of courage and gives him an amulet but warns him to only try it on when he's alone in his room. Jason does just that and makes a startling discovery. The amulet renders him invisible (I could already see where this was going).This was a really odd story. The story starts out light with the sexual awakening of a young man, until he realizes the person he really wants to be with has been right in front of him all the time, then turns dark when Sam's life is in danger.Jason is the geek. No one really pays him any attention except Danny, the high school jock and man whore. Danny has had Jason's back for years. Despite Danny's penchant for bedding any girl who wants him, he has always stuck to the ""bro code"" - not to sleep with the girl his best buddy is in lust over - Becky. Danny comes across as a jerk, but does a 360 towards the end of the story. Donna has been in love with Danny ever since he grabbed her for a quickie during prom while his date was occupied. Underneath her tough exterior lurks a softie, and she turns out to be a true friend. Samantha is sweet and innocent, but I found myself feeling sorry for her throughout the story.The idea of a teenage boy with the ability to become invisible sounded like the cliche boy fantasy, and I found it odd that a guy would even consider wearing an amulet. Yes, the characters are all young, but what that didn't bother me. Real life isn't much different. I was most disturbed by Becky's scene, but only because I already hated her by then. Becky's reasons for her deceit were ridiculous and she should have paid some price for it in the end. The author did write Jason and Sam's ending beautifully though, and it was a stark contrast to all the previous scenes which was nice.2.5 stars for a) grossly misused amulet for purely selfish reasons (spying on intimate moments, helping Danny's future career), only to be covered up by making Jason a hero in the end and b) a lack of consequences for some characters. I see there is a sequel -Amulet 2. I don't think I can handle the angst, so I won't be in any hurry to read them anytime soon.",Starts out light and turns dark.,1329523200,3,3

But after spending many a contemplative noon hour there, he observes something a bit odd about the statues.His subsequent quest to find information about the statures brings him more than he bargained for.This was a bit of an old-fashioned story with lovely but somewhat stilted writing.

"This book was a fast, fun read. Not only that though, it made me think a lot about humanity. Any book that is entertaining, well written, and thought provoking deserves five stars.This book was entertaining because I was completely immersed within the world the author created. There were many different view point characters and this allowed me to see the story as a whole instead of just one subjective view point. I read through the book quickly and am sure it will become one of those books that I re-read over and over.The characters were well defined and came alive. Each character had at least one aspect that I could relate to which made them seem real. As a writer myself, this is something I aim for my readers to be able to do and it is no easy feat. It's easy to see why the Citizens do what they do, to understand their reasoning, and almost sympathize with it, which is all necessary to have a good antagonist. The plot was much more than a simple dystopian, there were many twist that I couldn't see coming despite the subtle hints within the book. Again, this is not something that is easy to do and it is done well.The best part of this book was that, even though the world is vastly different from ours, I was left thinking about how the themes relate to humanity and out current way of life. I'm not looking for a big debate or anything so I'm not going to go into detail about it here but the thoughts this book left me with were shocking and won't be leaving me anytime soon.

No idea why; so I'm trying again.This books lacks suspense and it is not well researched.I'm willing to suspend disbelief in order to be entertained, but when glaring mistakes jump off a page at me I'm jerked back into reality; and pretty ticked. Research people! Research! If you intend to write a novel check everything from campground supervision to the actual ethnic makeup of small towns. The one that really fried me was the full blood Native American, a non-Navajo, with a Navajo last name.A main plot point referring to Mormon records and the colonies in Mexico is pretty far fetched. Mormons valued their records and if the colony was abandoned they would have taken their journals and personal histories as well as the church records with them. Those records would be housed in a church library somewhere not left to the elements in a ruin.I am a Mormon.

"I loved this book!  Korey Mae Johnson really hit the nail on the head with ""Pursuit of Glory.""Renny is a strong willed, emotional, and intelligent teenager living in a time of revolution and sexual inequality. She was raised by her father to be as quick and nimble as a man, but living in a society that believes that women are ornamental at best, she is never really able to showcase her talents. Renny flees from her father's home and discipline after he chastises her for being too blunt in front of the king. Little did she know that her escape would mark the beginning (instead of the end) of bare bottom spankings!My only criticism of Johnson's book involves the science fiction part of the story. Renny, like her father and his rival Logan, is an immortal. Her father and Logan drank from some sort of fountain of youth when they found themselves on a deserted island over 80 years ago. This fountain gave them and all of their offspring immortality. Personally, I am not a huge fan of science fiction and found its introduction into the story superfluous. That said, I don't think it detracted from the story, I just don't think it helped it either.""Pursuit of Glory"" is a well written book that would stand nicely on its own without a single spank. The spanking scenes are not forced; a scene isn't constructed solely for the purpose of ending in a spanking. Allowing the spanking scenes to be a natural part of the story makes for a great spanking novel! Korey Mae Johnson wrote a gripping story about a smart, witty, and bratty young girl who sparks a revolution and manages to make a difference, even though she ends up with a smarting bottom more than once in the process.

"I've always loved Doyle's Holmes stories so I was excited to read King's ""Beekeeping for Beginners"".  However, I was bored with this story.  The young girl, Mary Russell, seemed insipid and Holmes was too all knowing though I admit he was portrayed that way by Doyle too.  The aunt and cousin came across as stock figures of evil.  It was obvious from the beginning where the story was heading.Maybe my problem was that I haven't read anything else from King's series.  I'm sure having some background would probably enhance the reading of this story.  I can't help comparing King's story to Julian Barnes's novel ""Arthur and George"" based on Doyle's real life interaction with George Edalgi's and the false accusations Edalgi suffered from local law enforcement.  Both Mary Russell and Edalgi are mostly victims of their differentness and other's willingness to exploit them but other than that the two stories are worlds and words apart.

I WAS TOLD BY MY MOTHER THAT MY HERITAGE ON HER SIDE OF OUR FAMILY WAS ENGLISH, IRISH, AND WELSH. I LOVE HISTORY, YET I KNOW ALMOST NOTHING OF WALES. I HADN'T EVEN KNOWN THAT WALES WAS PART OF THE CELTIC RACE. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO NOW STUDYING WELSH HISTORY.

"I love Historicals especially American ones.  In this one the heroine , Chloe, is a strong woman who must find a way to save her home.  She is outspoken, somewhat plain in apprearance, and hardworking.  I love all heroines who fit that description.This book was well written and the interaction between Chloe and Travis was terrific.  I would highly recommend this book.  But if you are buying the Kindle version be forewarned that it has a few formatting errors and misspelled words.  Not enough to bother me. but some people don't want any.",Great Western With A Strong Heroine,1278806400,11,11

"I can't wait to read his next book. I love the characters. We have a place in Rancho Mirage, CA and it's fun to read about it in his books. Also, we have a friend with a cabin in Twain Harte so that was a real kick too! I would recommend all of Albert Simon's Henry Wright Mysteries.",Great read,1377475200,0,0
"In Moose Factory, Ontario, Cree Indian Will Bird lies comatose in the hospital after a beating.  While he ""dreams"" of his life as a bush pilot amongst other things, his niece Annie , a hunter, has come home after an eight-month search for her runaway sister Suzanne who has become a popular model in Manhattan, to be at her uncle's side.  Annie knows she has more in common with her uncle as a proficient hunter than she does with her younger ""urbanized party going sibling who is connected to the ruthless Netmakers drug smugglers.Will struggles for his life through his memories while Annie struggles to move past her efforts to connect with Suzanne.  Annie's boyfriend semi-hermit Gordon helps in his way.  However the brave female hunter reconsiders her walking away from New York as she ponders hunting two-legged animals to rescue her sister and provide homage to dying Will who also has a nefarious link to the Netmakers.This deep family drama contains two powerful contrasting story lines that ultimately converge.  The cast is fully developed with the three Birds as the key players who come across as genuine; while the support casts enhances understanding of their personalities or the locale of Ontario or Manhattan.  Although the probability of the ending occurring would have the odds of the Detroit Lions winning the next Superbowl, fans will relish the rustic stories of Will and Annie and to a lesser degree Suzanne in the city.Harriet Klausner",deep family drama,1239494400,2,2
I really like James' books. I think I've read them all. This just wasn't as interesting. It felt flat without as much characterization.,Okay at best,1389484800,0,0

"A story about pregnant women without husbands, baby mothers with problematic marriages, a married woman who doesn't want children but feels cut off from her friends who are mothers.A father who leaves his baby on a cafe doorstep because of his wife's post natal blues.  He supposedly has Asberger's.It's all too much and too weird to be believable even in a fiction book.",Not my cup of tea,1398643200,6,6
"3 stars. There were a lot of things I liked about this. It was definitely different, a little uncomfortable at times, and kinda hot. I liked Sylvan and Sophie and Baird...but good Lord did I just want to knock Olivia out. I mean...I get the resisting, I do, and I was with her...for a little bit, but then I was like, really? How long can we drag this out? I mean, if about a third (or half) of that part had been cut out I think I would have given it another star, it was just too much for me. And when she got pissed...anyhoosals, I may check out the next one, interested in the whole Allfather, Sophie, Baird's brother thing, but I may wait a bit...I need to read something with instant gratification to balance things out",3 stars,1386374400,0,0
"I've always been a big fan of stories that focus on the underdog defeating the the Nazi War Machine. This quick read makes you cheer for the good guy, or in this instance gal, and see if they will succeed with their plan.  The story has good twists and turns, yet the lack of true depth is was disappointed me the most about this book.  While it is a very quick read, this is one time where i would of liked it if the author could have added 100 to 150 pages to the story.  Good introductory book for a novice WW2 enthusiast.",Feel good story. Not much Depth,1390608000,0,0
