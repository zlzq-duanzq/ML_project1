"Kaylee is just happy, happy to have a bestfriend like Emma who is going to help her plot a little revenge on her ex-boyfriend who left her before homecoming and had the nerve to ask Emma instead of her.

She is about to scream in the middle of the mall and show the whole world her biggest secret: she is a freak.Or so she thinks. But in fact Kaylee doesn't know what's wrong with her, what are the shadows that she sees sometimes around people or why does she have this sudden urge to scream so badly when she spots one of these shadows.And now her secret is out because she couldn't help herself and HAD to do it.

I have finally read the first novella of the Soul Screamers series and now all I want to do is continue with the other books... but I have to take it easy, right? xDMy thoughts? I loved it. It was short and quick but it was so well written that I actually forged a bond with Kaylee. And that means a lot for me so... I have to stop writing and continue with the next one :DOops, before I leave, can I give you an advice? If you haven't read this series yet you might want to reconsider that.

"Being a tri-omega werewolf, Leland Summers knew he was special and that his future held two special people for him.  He knew werewolves had soul mates, but in his case he had two and someday he would find them, but he never expected his current photography job to lead him to the both of them.Meeting first Jake and then Luke, Leland didn't think life could get any better than what his two gorgeous mates had to offer him.  When Leland finds that Jake, the alpha of the pack, was already in love with Luke, his omega, Leland starts to wonder if there was a place in their life and hearts for him.Secret Desires is a fun and enjoyable story.  Leland is just adorable and he holds his own against his big, gorgeous and very overbearing lovers. Jake and Luke are the alpha and omega of a pack that chose to be with each other after being shunned by their own birth packs.  The chosen pack were wolves that really cared for one another and I think Leland fit in with them nicely.  Leland's mother, who was also a tri-omega, was a crack up.  She was so matter of fact and blunt it seemed like nothing fazed her.  It was obvious Leland took after her and not his two fathers.  Aside from Leland, Luke and Jake's romance, I was also very interested in Ryland and Gregory and I'm excited that the author Stormy Glenn isn't letting their story end with Secret Desires.  I really liked Secret Desires and I'm looking forward to more from Ms. Glenn regarding this series and other stories.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Secret Desires,1248220800,2,2,5,1

"Having been a devoted fan of Lovecraft all my life (he's my all-time favorite writer), I HAD to buy this book for the Kindle I just received today. It has almost all of his stories ... for only 1.99! That's less than 200 pennies! So far I only read From Beyond, one of my favorite stories of his. I found a few small typos, but that's okay.

"This book is a pretty good read, I like the character Janis Stone and how she is not a stick figure like so many book and movie characters are. The book starts out with Janis trying on her wedding dress, which doesn't go so well because she is not quite small enough for the size she is trying to wear, but why she is even considering marrying this guy Gary only because he is her last chance is a little ridiculous. Yes she is thirty-nine but that doesn't mean she has to settle for someone so belittling. I love how a voice just suddenly appears over the speakers everywhere and the arrogant way Primus Taddus basically says they are needing wives so they are taking some just deal with it.Now the parts of the book that really didn't do it for me is how when Janis and the good doctor get together finally and she is trying to find out more about the aliens that have taken them she is just all over him. I'm sorry but if I had been taken by a bunch of aliens and being forced to marry one I would be asking so many questions they would probably take me back haha.The reason I gave this book 4 stars is because I love how Janis and Dr. Delos get together in the end after battling Primus Thaddus.

"Eden LaCroix was trying to save the community center she was committed to preserving when Billy Buchanan breezed into her office announcing he was the engineer brought in as the consultant on the project.  She couldn't believe her eyes because the last time she had seen him he had literally fled, leaving her with her prom dress around her ankles at the Motel 6, ten long years ago.  She hadn't missed the almost physical relationship they had, but the friend that she trusted and confided in.Billy had reached a crossroads in his life.  He was at the top of his game in his professional life, but nothing else in his life satisfied him.  When he was asked to consult on a project in his hometown, he jumped at it.  Eden had never been far from his thoughts, and now he was going home to claim the woman made for him.  He didn't expect this to be an easy journey for him because his treatment of her so many years ago had been nothing short of abysmal.  His behavior was only one barrier keeping them apart, and the other was that his decision on the community center would have such a huge impact on Eden's life.  Billy could very well be stripping her job out from under her if his recommendation is to condemn the current building housing the center.  With all the issues circling them, Eden tried to resist the pull she felt toward Billy, but it was inevitable that they succumb to the intense heat between them.Eden is a strong character that has not had an easy life, but the loss of Billy was one loss she never recovered from.  Billy realized his error in judgment early on, and was back to claim the woman that had held his heart since high school.  While Eden scrambled to keep her armor in place, Billy did everything he could think of to penetrate it.  Well-rounded characters, but the story is not up to the caliber I expect from this author, but still an enjoyable read.",Wicked Garden,1227312000,3,3,4,1

"So I, like many other reviewers, must agree with EnvyNone, who really summed this book up so dang well, so well in fact that I almost didn't write this review. Alas, I feel like I owe the writer my individual feedback so here goes...Basically this is a very good story of unlikely love and attraction between a black suburban relationship writer, and a rather urban white rapper. The author did a good job with giving the reader a sense of who Rick and Carolyn were, where they came from, and why they were falling for each other. As characters, both Carolyn and Rick were well rounded, and though their conversations often made me feel like an intruder in a private conversation, I enjoyed their witty banter. Additionally, the story drew me in and kept me engaged simply because I wanted everything to work out for these two.On the other hand, the story was very long, had some rough patches where I was so confused about what was really going on and what the heck the characters were talking about, and there were some scenes that simply could have been left out. At times I really just wanted them to spit out what they wanted to say and make it plain. Enough dang metaphors and coded phrases, all of which seemed to hint at something that I clearly was not privy to. With that said, and again, what really saved this story, and allowed me to actually finish, was my interest in how this mess was going to work itself out...and I'm glad that it did, otherwise I would have been upset that I invested so much time reading and deciphering the story. I would read another story by this writer, and hope that some of the reviews she has received will help her workout some of the kinks.","Overall good story, with some rough patches",1323302400,1,1,4,1

"Empowering.... That is the word i think, for me, describes Fated by Lauren Dane! We get to feel and go through everything with Megan and Shane. The roller coaster of emotions and the fight for them to make it. Megan is a strong and fierce character and something all of us women should dominate in our own personal lives. It was captivating to see the main male character, Shane, to be the person to have the fears and anxiety of everything that was going on and surrounding him. But for this book, that was a refreshing change. I loved finding out about Shane's family history, which helped explain the reasons and fears he had. Me personally, i will be grateful for all the little snippets that Lauren Dane gave us for the other members of The Warden Clan in Fated. It has been a pleasure finding out what they are doing, where they are in their lives and how much they have changed an adapted. Once again, Fated is a 5 star book that i will recommend to anybody and everybody.",Simply.... WOW!,1352160000,0,0,5,1

"This isn't really a horror novella.  I wouldn't say it's suspense either.  As with many other Nicholson works it's hard to put it in any one category.Roby Snow is helping the Ridgehorn family through the loss of their recently lost patriarch Jacob.  Roby is a distant relation you see and that's what family does right?  Being such a distant relation to the deceased how can he be of much help though?  He can be thoughtful and help clean up the kitchen during the sitting...offer a shoulder to cry on...and....offer each and every one of the family pie....again and again..until they eat it...What's up with the pie?I'm not telling =)This is more a character study.  While Roby is the central character as it follows his plight to give aid to the deceased and his survivors, we're shown just how each and every one of the remaining family reacts and handles the recent loss of a husband and father.  Greed, shock, anger.  Each one of the family shows at least one of these emotions and many more.Of course it's not as simple as all that because there's an interesting Nicholson twist thrown in there ;)The story is short (it's just a novella after all) but it's completely worth reading.

"Plasmids from outer space invade a small Missouri town. They come in on a meteor which explodes over an abandoned farm and begin to infect feral cats The really creepy scenes with the cats are interspersed with scenes of normal people leading normal lives and this helps ratchet the suspense higher. Soon the Army is involved, but the military chooses to avoid alarming the locals, which leads to further complications.The story is told from multiple points of view. Some of the characters are likable and some despicable, but all are about to be in deep trouble as the plasmids multiply and prepare for takeover of the people of Earth. And those cats! Warning: the scenes with the cats are not for the squeamish.The writing and descriptions were well-done and there was plenty of conflict. Though some of the characters expressed insights that helped to give them depth, I didn't feel a real connection with them. This may have been because there were so many characters involved. Still, I would like to have had a better feel for the main characters, particularly Gordon.Action scenes were long and drawn out, which slowed the pace more than I would have liked. The final part of the book where the battle was over and the surviving characters recuperated was also a bit too drawn out for my tastes.Overall, though, a suspenseful book with a lot of action and conflict. Well worth reading.",Alien Invasion,1263859200,3,3,4,1

"It came to me what these books are. They are an echo of earlier pulp science fiction. Either a John Carter, Warlord of Mars or something that Edmond Hamilton would write or something else you can decide for yourself. Basically a series that is short on any technical aspects but long on action. A swashbuckler, who saves the day and wins the exotic lady fair. I do not say this is a bad thing in fact it can be down right entertaining.  That is basically what this series is just plain entertaining, form what I have read so far.It will never be in the league of a Asimov, Clarke or even a Weber written book but does it have to be?

"I really loved this story.  I reminded me of when I read Dracula for the first time drawing me into the world of Victorian England sprinkled with things that go bump in the night.  The characters Jason Dark and Siu Lin were instantly real without cumbersome, unnecessary description.  From the first few lines the story starts off with a bang and keeps moving along at a brisk pace without being predictable.  The violent scenes are written well using suspense and action to tell the story rather than resorting to bloody, gory descriptions.

"This is the prequel to the Soul Screamers series  It's just an eBook novella and you certainly don't have to read it to start the series.This book introduces the main characters of Kaylee (the main character), her best friend Emma, Kaylee's cousin Sophie, and Kaylee's Aunt Val and Uncle Brendon and mentions Kaylee's classmate, Nash.It's a quick read, but it introduces you to Kaylee's unique problem, which is that she sometimes has uncontrollable screaming fits.  You'll find out why in the next book.It was a freebie on Kindle, so I snagged it and became intrigued by Vincent's writing.  I have seen this series compared to Twilight but that's just mean.

His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing.  Besides misspellings and incorrect usage, this one has many compound words written separately as two.  The pictures on the 'milk cartoons' was the last straw; 'milk cartoons' was referred to several times.  Spellcheck is not an editor.

The main protagonist of this novel runs a high powered protection agency with celebrity and political clients.  Unknown to these he is also a paranoid schizophrenic controlled on drugs.  When these are withdrawn he degenerates into total schizophrenia and becomes programmed to attack those he is engaged to protect.  His personal relationships also understandably start to disintegrate also as he decompensates. Is this just his schizophrenia or a plot to assasinate.  The story grips throughout and is well worth the read.  Could have had a little better editing but the pace of the tale gets over these minor problems.  Great for a debut novel and look forward to the author's further offerings.,Interesting view into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic,1293235200,1,1,4,1

"Regardless of grammar errors or misuse of commas I love this series.  I am on the 5th one right now and find it just as interesting as the first.  I am looking forward to the 6th and 7th one as well.  I love the action, would have given it 5 stars but as some have pointed out I was not thrilled how woman were portrayed until they were trained.  Another problem I had was with the dialogue when explaining how things were built.  I love strong female characters in books I read and there are a few in this series but it seems they all endured heinous crimes at one time or another.  Lina was great when first introduced but then she suffered from bad things happening to her.  Namid is strong now but she had to suffer as well.  I love the interaction between Jim, Pete, Tim, Pol, Bill, Lieutenant Wilcox and a few others.  I love how they are surviving to the best of their abilities when there is no government in place due to disasters happening world wide..I love how each book has a different element that they must face and defeat..I just find it so fascinating because truth be told you have to wonder would it really be like that if it were to truly happen...Overall its a fascinating series that I have thoroughly enjoyed reading..but that is just my opinion.  :)",Interesting Concept,1315526400,1,1,4,1
"I remember reading this book a few years ago and the story of Katie and Cutter has always remained with me, as one of the saddest yet sweet books. The writing of this story is very good, it is erotica though with a solid love story thrown in.

"This novella is short-just 95 pages, but it has a little bit of everything-mystery, romance, and hawt love scenes. In a lot of novellas I've discovered that the storyline sometimes doesn't work because before you have a feel for the characters, the story is over. Not so with this novella. I immediately connected with both the heroine and heroes of the story. Alexia is just the type of heroine I like-strong, spunky, independent, but at the same time likable. She isn't one of those girls who goes ""oh no, I just discovered that i can shapeshift, my life is over with."" She handles the situation with style and grace. Joshua and Anthony are great-I liked both of them right away. They aren't your typical Alpha males, but I think that's what I liked best about them. They protected Alexia, but let her make her own decisions. The conniving Grams was probably my favorite character-she just had me laughing and reminded me of my own Grandma.  All in all this was a great short read that left me wanting a merfolk of my own!

"Having retired from the Marine Corps and with tours aboard ships, I was somewhat interested in this title by Gordan Runyan and was willing to give it a chance. I have read many techno-thrillers and it is easy to get burned out with them. Unfortunately, in most top-selling techno-novels, the technical stuff can get a bit boring and easily clog up the plot.Also, as a practicing and ""born again"" Christian, I was a little unsure how in the world an author could meld the Christian aspect with a technical thriller. Would it be ""hokey"" or would it beat the reader to death? I should not have worried!I must admit, this is a phenomenal story, outstanding characters, and many may find a lot in their own lives mirrored here! The author sure ""knows"" people and their inner thoughts! The plot is superbly scary with North Korea as the antagonist. Extremely plausible story line. It grips you from the very beginning and goes to the last page. One more thing, it is also a ""love"" story!This, being the author's only fiction book, has me amazed. Clancy, Weber, and other techno-writers better watch out if this guy ever decides to go full-time fiction writing!Lastly, as a Christian, I was absolutely absorbed in the Biblical aspects and quotes. If you are not a practicing Christian, read the book anyway. You won't be put off, and may learn a thing or two!If you are a practicing Christian, you will surely shed a few heart-felt tears! I did! Thank you Mr. Runyan for a wonderful novel!",Unbelievably Great Read!,1358640000,1,1,5,1

"This 8,000 worded thriller, tackled by two authors no less, completely took me by surprise. In reading, that is always a good thing.

"If I had to compare this very nice seasonal romance by Treva Harte to a painting, it would be an impressionist one. Maybe due to the length, a novella, or maybe due to the choice of the author to focus on the present more than the past, we don't have many details around the characters, but just an impression of who they were and what they now want. And more than a ""thanksgiving"" romance, this is a forgiving one.Both Paul than Emerson did wrong in the past, Paul was too young and hot-tempered to realize what he had before losing it, and Emerson had a too low self-esteem to grab for happiness, and to admit that a little fault on him didn't make him a total loser.Despite many arguments, tug in and tug off, and great makeover s ex, it's already 8 years that Paul and Emerson are ""unofficially"" a couple. They met in college, Paul a singer and Emerson a composer, they seemed perfect for each other; but when Paul was ready to spring the wings and fly, Emerson decided to remain grounded. They argued, Paul didn't ask, and Emerson didn't offer, and so, year after year, Paul is coming back to Emerson for Thanksgiving, they have great s ex and the morning after Paul is gone again. Only that this year both of them want to break the spell and change the course of their life.Being a romantic as I am, I feel a bit of regret for all the years Paul and Emerson lost, but, after all, it is probably better like that. If they managed to stay together so since moment one, both so young and inexperienced, probably they would have grown tired of each other soon after. In this way instead, both of them regarded their college love affair like the best years of their life and it remained the unfulfilled dream they now, as adults, want to realize. Now both of them are ready to commit, now both of them realized what they lost, and lucky for them, they are still young enough to enjoy their future together.As for their past history together, also the present is described more through flash of image than a real flow of events. The reader jump from a scene to another like he is shifting in time, and in the space of few pages he spent an year together with Paul and Emerson. Each scene, again, is made more of feelings and sensations than details, cold, warm, fear, love, this is what the reader perceive more than the visual image of the places. It's quite a strange novella, but very sweet and romantic.",Leftovers by Treva Harte,1266192000,0,0,5,1

"Initially I thought this was going to be more of a creature type horror story, similar to The Mist. It's not, while they hint of something in the fog it is never explained, all you know is whatever goes in ends up screaming and me ere coming back out. Instead it's more about how a camp full of kids set out to survive and establish a community. The best comparison I could give is a modern day Lord of the Flies meets Hatchet. These kids manage to not only to survive but thrive and do better than most of the adults you will meet along the way.I wish they would have explained the fog more. It attempts to at the very beginning but then never explAins further. It doesn't detract from the story at all it's just my own curiosity, I want to know! That really is my only complaint.

Would like to know why she wasn't sure about her family meeting him.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this particular author.",Got to love Danny,1262908800,0,0,5,1

"After reading Eric Christopherson's marvelous thriller ""Crack-Up,"" I was highly skeptical that the author could repeat such a success. I was wrong, very wrong. ""Frame-Up,"" by Mr. Christopherson and co-author Brad Schoenfeld, is every bit the equal of ""Crack-Up"" for ratcheting up the tension as the reader wonders if Will Pruett will really be executed for a murder he framed himself on.Even after will realizes that he's been suckered into framing himself for the murder of a cop, it's no certainty that he can escape the death penalty. His only hope lies in convincing police detectives Ortiz and Dyrstad of his innocence, not an easy job, especially with the Manhattan DA pushing for quick justice to help his struggling campaign for re-election. Fortunately for Will, the two detectives are determined to find the truth, despite having to sift through the red herrings in their way.There are some memorable characters in ""Frame-Up."" Will Pruett is cool as a cucumber as he goes through the arrest process, but he never bargained on the dangers waiting for him at the jail on Rykers Island. Samantha Ortiz is a spicy enchilada of a detective who's going to prosecute Pruett all the way to the death chamber, and it appears that she's succeeding.If you're into nonstop action thrillers, ""Frame-Up"" is for you .",Author does it again,1270944000,14,14,5,1
I looked at one review and had to start to agree with the person. I happen to be completely familiar with Doc's works. Then I stepped back for a moment and asked my self why was I getting these copies on Kindle to start with.For one I had lost my complete collection of all my SY~FI collections. I had well over ten thousand volumes Some of them I had read two or three times.I wished to see if I could replace some of it with the Kindle editions. I do hope so. Still is it worth the attempt? For me it is. This is my small attempt to recoup my losses.I not only hope to be able to Get a new start. I also hope that by my purchase of these few titles. I will help to make it worthwhile to the folks interested in creating kindle books. They will say hey some folks are buying lets put out more editions and get more folks buying. So I am trying to get them to make more and you folks to buy more.It kind of reminds me of the old cartoon. The coyote falls in the snow and starts rolling. Or one small snow ball he throws starts to roll down hill Towards him. Away he goes all the time the snowball is growing and growing. Then whummp it hits the take off ramp. sending it towards the sky.We all know what is going to happen we see the small dot on the ground and it is getting bigger and bigger. The one of two things.

She populated her world with characters that had depth and believability.  I also liked that she let Selena and Dan develop feelings for each other over time.

There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not, if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not.

"A competent thriller that succeeds on most levels. It's economically written, authoritative about newspaper newsrooms and statehouse journalism, and its characters are skillfully drawn (if slightly cliched; does every newsroom in fiction have an alcoholic burnout of a onetime star reporter on his last chance?).The clockspring tension and suspense is well-developed, though the moralizing about the rapacious nature of news reportage goes a bit over the top. The reveal of the killer, which offers a clever twist on real Harrisburg history (look up R. Budd Dwyer for a look at the true horror story than inspired ""Kill The Story""), leads to a delicious doozy of a climactic scene.My only real complaint, as another reviewer here aptly pointed out, is that there is no way the reader could have guessed the identity of the killer before the big reveal. That made the reveal less of a powerhouse moment then it could have and should have been, and made the ponderous exercise of piecing together the connection between the murder victims to that point into an elaborate jerk-around at the readers' expense.Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the text contained more typos and other careless errors than should ever have come from a self-respecting journalist (which the author obviously was at one time). It just goes to show that every writer needs a strong copy editor.All in all, however, ""Kill The Story"" is a reasonably well-crafted thriller that largely delivers on its intriguing premise. I'll definitely check out more of John Luciew's work.","A Few Flaws, but An Above-Average Thriller",1295568000,0,0,4,1

"Morgan had spent one wonderful week in Aruba. She met Bryan Cailborn. When Morgan got back home she found out that she was pregnant. She started contacting Bryan, but never got a reply. When she did get a reply Bryan said he didn't know her. Morgan was a music teacher. Her school district had to let her go because of budget cuts. Morgan packed up everything and moved to Chicago. She was going to see Bryan face to face and no one was going to stop her! When she got to Bryan's office, his sectary said that he was busy and told her to make an appointment. Morgan barged into a conference room, and asked to see Bryan. This handsome, tall man that she had never seen before said I am Bryan. Before she could retreat, her water broke, and her contractions were painful, keeping her rooted to where she stood. He picked her up and took her to his office and laid her on his couch. When she was in the office she saw a picture of the person she knew as Bryan, with the man that just said he was Bryan. She pointed and said that is Bryan, I want to see him now. Bryan said that is my brother Dillon, and I'm afraid you can't see him. Dillon died 6 months ago. Dillon would often take trips and use his brother's name, and his credit cards, leaving Bryan to clean up his mess. The ambulance came, and Bryan asked Morgan who he could call for her. She said no body.  Morgan was an only child, and both of her parents had died the month before Morgan took her trip to Aruba. The Cailborn family was very wealthy, so everyone thought Morgan was there as a gold digger. In truth she was there because she wanted her son to know his family. This story really touched my heart. When everyone finally trusted Morgan to be who she really was, everyone loved and accepted her. I loved it the first time she met Bryan's parents. There were tears shed. They really wanted to be grandparents to Brice. I couldn't put this book down until I was finished with it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Loved this story!,1366502400,0,0,5,1

"Overall this was an entertaining story.  I really like the way this author builds the relationship between the H and the h.  She did this rather well in this story as well.  I also like how strong her female characters usually are.  There is one thing that annoyed me.  After the h asks the H to make a bigger comittment the H pretty much freaks and bails on her, in Mexico no less.  After a month she tries to reconnect with him as friends and he blows her off again.  Even though this guy was not a complete jerk it really annoyed me that he strolls in on her and declares that he has changed his mind taking for granted that she would drop everything and have him back, this is after months apart and him telling her that he had gone out on a date.  She of course is so happy she takes him back without a single doubt.  GRRR!!!  I love this author but it really annoys me when writers take a strong female character and resolve the story by just having her forgive and forget so easily.  Especially when the h was such a strong character.  Even though the H concedes to her in the end it was still really annoying that she did not even utter any hesitation.  That was why I gave it four stars instead of a five.  Other than that it was a great story.",SPOILERS....,1301788800,7,7,4,1

"This story is about a runaway teen named Two, that ends up on the streets and has been turned into a 'working girl' to survive. Her pimp has gotten her hooked on heroine and she does as he orders for her next high. One night she is specially requested by a high paying customer. It turns out that the 'client' happens to be a vampire that has plans for her that do not include allowing her to remain in her current line of work. His plans are a little more life changing. Thereon wants to turn Two and keep her with him forever;however, his creater and master Abraham doesn't agree. Buecheler adds his own spin on the creation of vampires and their ability to remain a creature of the night. This is a good read. There are strong characters, and you may not always like the way the story goes, but it's more realistic to have some down times I suppose. There are some grammer errors, but it's not too bad for self published book. It's also free, so you can't complain. It's a full story, but it allows for a sequel, which is more than can be said for alot of the other free ebooks. Overall, it was a good read. I would recomend it to friends and it's nice to see a change on the typical vampire story line. I, for one, am waiting for the next book in what is planned to be a trilogy.",Great new take on the vampire theory.,1318809600,0,0,4,1
"Finished this book last night but felt like I needed time to digest what I had read before I could write this review. The beginning sucked me in, the middle was slow in some parts and fast in others and the ending...well I have I have to say is Wow! The ending had me on the edge of my seat and I felt like I couldn't read fast enough to find out what was going to happen. Very few grammatical errors (which is a big plus for me, especially in an e-book) but I will say the one thing I didn't like about this book was the use of the dash symbol (-), alot! I kept having to re-read paragraphs because I felt like I was missing words or something was suppose to be hyphenated, where a comma would of made the book flow so much better. Through the book, I kept thinking Man, this should be a movie because it is just the kind of movies I love! I'm not sure why but I fell in love with the character of Mr. Night, he is so wise and knowledgeable, and I love the references to where some of his items in his conjure kit came from. I felt like there was some skipping around in the middle and some characters didn't get the much ""attention"". Overall, the story was a frighteningly good read! I may have to re-read it come Halloween time! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a haunting story and am anxious to read more from this author!!!",Amazing Spooky Read!!,1304812800,1,1,4,1

"As much as I love fantasy, I don't read a lot of that genre nowadays, since it's so hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, with so many authors trying to be the next Tolkien or Rowling. Nevertheless, I had seen some favorable comments about ""Sage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom,"" and I noticed that it was a short book, so I downloaded it for my Kindle.It's a nice concept. The author, Maria E. Schneider, has created a mythical magical kingdom and introduced the reader to this realm through three short stories featuring the main characters. In a different twist, instead of having a world inhabited by ordinary people with a scattering of wizards, witches, and the like, in Sage, everyone is a magician of sorts, with each person specializing in a certain form of magic. The first character we're introduced to is Demetria, an aging grandmother who is a Master Gardener, having the ability to communicate with and influence plants. Demetria's husband, Ward, is a Stone Master, who has the power to manipulate stones (which comes in very handy in one of the stories).In the first of the three stories, ""Toil Trouble and Rot,"" Demetria discovers that the kingdom's crops are rotting due to a magic fungus introduced by Sage's arch enemies, the Rats who live just beyond Sage's borders. Demetria and Ward, with their children, Gavin and Xylia, set off to determine the extent of the damage and to destroy the fungus. With help from their friends, each of whom has a special magical power, they go in harm's way to battle the fungus, which is as deadly to humans as it is to plants.""Dungeons and Decay,"" the second story, is about a search for Demetria and Ward's son Gavin, who is missing and is feared to have been captured by the Rats in the kingdom of Ratdom. In ""Call to Arms,"" the third story, Demetria and Ward and their friends are involved in some nastiness by creepy crawlers from the Slithering Kingdom.Sage is a magical kingdom, but the magic is white magic, or earth magic, where the human inhabitants are finely attuned to their natural surroundings and can subtly influence and communicate with objects like trees and stones and animals. There are no wizards hurling lightning bolts or casting evil spells in Sage, which was a relief from the typical fantasy story. In that sense, Sage is reminiscent of an earlier time in history when people were more aware of the natural world and their surroundings. Demetria, Ward, and the others in Sage are interesting characters and certainly sympathetic ones as they go about protecting their land from the dangerous, evil creatures who surround them.Ms. Schneider's writing is very polished and professional, and I found no spelling or grammar errors. Also, the Kindle formatting was perfect. I take neither of these for granted, and the author obviously took a great deal of care in editing, the bane of many authors today.I'm not sure what kind of reading audience ""Sage"" is targeted toward, but in my opinion, it's suitable for children through adults. There are some scenes that might frighten a very young child, but any kid who made it through Harry Potter would certainly be okay with ""Sage.""My only negative comment - and it's a very minor one - is that there are only three stories in the book. The magical realm that Ms. Schneider has created certainly invites more stories, possibly even a full-length novel about Sage and its people and their relationships with other lands and people beyond its borders.In the fantasy genre, it's getting harder and harder to find new books that are both original and well written. Maria Schneider has written a winner with ""Sage.""",A fantasy winner!,1254096000,10,10,5,1

"When I first started reading this romance, the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona, because as I read further and learned more about him, he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde, which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.Of course Lila who was 'Beauty' was as beautiful inside as outside.  In the original fairy tale, the beast has a bad temper  as part of his curse, so having the 'beast' in this story be bad tempered goes along with that.","""Beauty and the Beast""",1276560000,0,0,4,1
"Honestly, I thought about giving this one a 4.5 but then I thought about my reasoning. The only reason I'd do that is because it was short and sweet. Ok, only because it was short?

It seemed so fun.There was definitely a fun twist at the end that had my gears spinning but it was fun and lighthearted. Poor Olivia always protesting even up to the last scene. I really loved Olivia. She was so exciting and as I said before I would have loved to learn more about her.While I wanted more, I was definitely happy with what I got.

"Judd Romeo had one goal in life, and that was to win the professional bull riding world title.  No one - other than his mother - understood his passion for the sport; but now she was gone and Judd was left with settling her Kentucky estate months before the world competition.  What Judd wasn't expecting to deal with upon his return to his mother's home, was the feelings he still carried deep inside his heart for Mandy Sullivan, a love that he hadn't seen since their high school breakup.  Now, that he was older and wiser, will Judd allow Mandy to slip through his fingers a second time without a fight?Mandy Sullivan refused to associate with risk-takers because her father was one before it finally caused the death of him and her mother.  That's why she broke up with Judd Romeo on their Senior Prom night, and the main reason that she was raising her niece after her sister left her newborn daughter in order to become a Hollywood star.  So, why after all these years did Mandy still want Judd, especially now when he was a skilled bull rider - but how could she not support an emotionally wounded man that had recently lost his beloved mother?  And, it didn't help matters when her sister reappeared after an eight year hiatus wanting to reclaim her daughter - a child that Mandy considered her own.  Mandy's world was falling apart.  Will she welcome Judd's love and support?Kentucky Cowboy was a wonderful, heartfelt western romance that I really enjoyed reading.  It was a classic tale about tragedy, despair, love and second chances.  Judd was my type of cowboy - he was very tough when needed to be, compassionate and downright gorgeous.  There was no woman who could resist his alluring southern charm, not even Mandy. No matter how hard she tried to fight it, the desire was still strong between them.  The plot moved at an excellent pace while showing the difficult process of rediscovery and forgiveness.  Readers, you can't go wrong with Kentucky Cowboy!NikitaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Kentucky Cowboy,1273190400,3,3,5,1

"I really like this book. Ms. Marinelli has a good ability to grasp her readers with just enough detail, not too much. This novel is a good glimpse of hope and second chances with one's spouse.  But, I have a couple of critiques.First of all, Ms. Marinelli seems to forget, like a lot of modern romance novelists, that her readers have an imagination of their own. It is my humble opinion that people who love to read are also very creative, imaginative and inventive.  As a result, they only need to be guided and engaged, but left to piece the obvious themselves.  I specifically refer to the scenes that only a spouse and a wife should be a part of. Its cliche and annoying to encounter the unnecessary descriptions of these scenes in a book such as this one.This book is really beautifully written and throwing in a piece of what Hollywood claims sells only cheapens things.  There is a beauty in leaving some things to the imagination.  I challenge Ms. Marinelli to be different.  She is an amazing writer.  I challenge her to believe in her skills as a writer and protest the status quo of cheap romance novels.Secondly, I also challenge her to look into a faith in God that she may be holding back.  It seems she was tempted to attribute the 'coincidental' occurences in the book to Him, but she held herself back by only saying 'someone' was looking out for the main characters.  Of the couple times that she mentions God by name, one is at a moment to blame Him for what 'went wrong' and another is to reduce Him to a buffet style God that one can pull apart for the pieces that are convenient to us.  And with this again, I challenge her to be different.Believe it or not, for as many people who read romance novels for the 'steamy' scenes, there are that many more who read them for hope in something more.  For some the belief that love is possible, for others that there is hope after difficulties and for others perhaps a good and clean escape.  Maybe your temptation to include God is not a mere coincidence as He does lead to good and hope filled love.I truly loved this book and only gave it one star away from perfect because I choose not to share it with others for the first reason I mentioned above.  I found myself having to skip those pages getting an idea of what was coming.  I do appreciate the warning at least.  But, call it pruddish or whatever else you may but I still believe in there being a lot more said when sometimes nothing is said at all but instead just understood.",Hope,1345507200,2,2,4,1

"4.5 StarsTears of the Reaper is the fourth book in the Western Wind series by Charlotte Boyett-Compo.  This book can be read as a standalone, but you will be missing out on three great books each with a compelling story and red, hot romance.Owen Toure has survived a hellish nightmare and betrayal beyond belief.  The latest damage to his soul and psyche drive him to find escape in the arms of a drug meant to help control reaper transformations.  He knows he is ill and is making his way back to the citadel he crosses into other territory to save a boy in danger.  He awakes after rescuing the boy to unknown faces.  One of the faces is that of a woman, Rachel Lawrence, that he has never met.  He finds himself very strongly attracted to this timid young woman.  Their story features heartbreak, brutal suffering, and a love that conquers all.The storyline moved along at a fast pace and there were numerous conflicts and plot twists to keep the reader interested.  Once I started reading it I couldn't stop.  I had to know what happened to Rachel.  I was rooting for Owen to be her hero, and I found my eyes tearing up at the lengths that Owen would go to ensure her safety.  The characters were very well written, and the story had just the right amount of suspense and romance.  I will say that I have read the other books in the series previous to this one and that added to my pleasure.  Each new book seems to be better than the last.  The author has a real talent for pulling main characters out and highlighting their stories while using the secondary characters' previous and forthcoming storylines to blend past, present, and future in a way that makes me feel like I'm with old friends.  Since this is my fourth book in the series I definitely feel that I am part of the reaper family.True to her writing style Charlotte Boyett-Compo features other members of the brotherhood, adventure, suspense, a triumph of good over evil, and steamy love scenes.

"I became attached to the characters. I liked the series for the most part. I only had 2 complaints. The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters, that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However, the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing, I'm not sure how to put into words, but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example, Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this. I got the point the 1st 2 times they explained their thoughts and feelings.  For the most part, I liked the series. Just these 2 points bothered me.",attached to the characters,1394323200,0,0,4,1

"I can't understand all of the 1 star reviews complaining that it stops right when the story is getting good. The author plainly states in the product description that this is a novella prequel to three full length novels already written.

The writing is good, the authors hooks you into the story quickly, and even though the story is about a teenage girl and probably written for young adults, I think it is a good summer read for adults. Something that is an easy read with a page turning plot. My personal favorite 1star review complains that there is too much description for the plot. Ummm, okay. If this is too much description, than the plot of the entire Twilight series can be summed up in less than a paragraph. And Harry Potter in a page. That is the point of a novel. The author should draw you into the world they have created through their descriptions. You should be in Lakeside with Kaylee, smell the hospital smells and feel her confusion and frustrations.

"Ross Benson, Viscount Winterton, is recently returned from Africa.  He is a jaded rake of a man, and the object of many women's fantasies.  He and Timothy Rollins are arriving back at Ivydale Manor, drunk, when they wake young Cassandra, Timothy's sister, who helps both men to bed.  When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.Ross is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.Scarletreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",In a Reckless Moment,1210896000,1,1,5,1
"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure, few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook, you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series, which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series, which includes Swords of Talera, Wings Over Talera, and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books, and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition.",Pure adventure,1316822400,5,5,5,1

"There is one story in this download, This is Not a Love Story, taken from the collectionReasons for and Advantages of Breathing: Stories (P.S.). So, while this download here is only the one story, and a short one at that, it is more than enough story.Told in first person, a woman remembers a time in her life when she was young and had time to waste and time for mistakes. An old stack of black and white photos brings back memories of when the narrator was twenty-two and maybe reckless. She decided on an adventure, leaving Connecticut for the unknown- the South, and there, the ""wide-eyed Yankee college girl"" met a man twice her age. She began a relationship with Tommy, and if that was love, it was dysfunctional.Just as the narrator and Tommy are characters in this story, the South is there, too, in all its natural beauty and man-made ugliness, serving as a mirror for Tommy, for those good and dark parts of him. Just like Tommy, nothing in this place ""was what it seemed, nothing was permanent, and so much was concealed."" After I finished this story, I kept thinking about it, about those people and places who have hidden truths and old ghosts, about those wrong turns we take in life and the lessons they teach us.There is so much depth to this story. It is written in such a masterful way, with complete control of language, no word unnecessary, no word contrived, just wonderfully well-written in every way. This is what a short story can and should be-- complete, short but substantial, and layered with meaning and feeling. To me, this story was brilliantly done.",Seeing clear through,1321488000,14,14,5,1

Well, that's not entirely true - Cole knows why, he just doesn't want to admit it to himself and most especially to others.  But when he comes across Eric Radcliff his libido and fantasies get out of control.  Will Cole be brave enough to admit what he really wants and see where this attraction to Eric will take them?Eric Radcliff has always had the hots for Cole and when Cole trips over him at the beach it seems his interest might be returned.  But Cole is sending so many mixed signals that Eric might just have to satisfy himself with his fantasies.  Will Cole ever let them explore passion together or will he keep denying himself?Taboo Desires is a wonderful steamy romance.  Cole and Eric are absolutely explosive together and you won't be able to help wanting them for your own.  Cole is endearing as he wrestles with himself and his hidden desires, while Eric is adorable and charming in his certainty of himself.  Taboo Desires is the perfect read for a time when you are looking for some light, but steamy, entertainment that is mostly about the anticipation and the satisfaction of getting what you desire without dealing with the aftermath.

At some points I became very frustrated with the characters and the situations, but later I realized that the author had to develop the scenes this way in order to stay true to who the characters really are. It's not your typical sci-fi, dystopian romance but that's because both charater's are a bit naive with relationships.The writing is good but could use improvement (the third person POV is very shallow and there are a bit too many adverbs and passive sentences). But there is definite potential in this author and hopefully she will gain experience and learn from her first novel to keep improving.In any case, the story was good enough to keep me interested until the end, which for me equals an entertaining read.",Good first novel.

And, beware, the end of the book is open, I was for once glad for the insight on the first chapter ofCamp Hell: A Psycop Novel.I loved the story. For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me.

It starts with a journalist, whose grandmother is dying, wishing to write a story about the clinic where she has spent her last days. It is soon apparent that all may not be as it seems and the reader is left in doubt as to whether the clinic is trying to help people end their days peacefully or there is an ulterior motive and the story changes to more of a medical mystery with the central character trying to get to the bottom of what is going on. The story is fast paced and you get a real feel for the characters particularly with the journalist's disabled girlfriend. At the end a decision needs to be made and the reader is left to think which way the story is going to go.

"Synopsis: Meagan is hallucinating a gorgeous guy in her shower and at work. While entertaining, she can't control it. If he's not just some random daydream, but is a real person sending her visions; then who is he? And why is he doing this? And how does he know her name? She also must find a way to handle being a witch serving a powerful goddess, whose agenda doesn't coincide with Meagan's...My Thoughts: I read this book last summer and really enjoyed it.  It is true that it could use some additional editing, but it wasn't enough of a problem for me to ruin my enjoyment of the book.  I found the relationship between the young witch, Meagan, and her newly discovered soulmate to be an interesting one, and while it moved quite quickly, my own life experience backs me up on declaring this is not an impossible thing.  The story kept me engaged and I've been hoping to see the next book in this series come up.

"This story by Louis L'Amour was the very first of his novels that I ever read.  Novels with a western theme were not my thing when I was growning up, so imagine my surprise when I just sort of drifted into this book one rainy afternoon.  I guess I was attracted to it by the fact that it opens in New York City, not the deserts of New Mexico.Anyway, I soon found that L'Amour has a writing style just as smooth as silk, and I found myself sliding into this book as easily as if he took me by the hand and led me to an alter.  Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.  Others have outlined the text already, so I won't bore you with yet another outline.  I'll just say that if you have not read any of Louis L'Amour in the past, this would be a really great place to start, or even to get reacquainted.  While you do that, I'm gonna find another L'Amour book to read.:)",A Good Afternoon Read,1248480000,0,0,5,1
"Rebecca `Becky' Yaeger's plans for the evening did not include being attacked by a psycho who sprouts claws and fangs.  It was supposed to be a fun filled evening with friends at a masquerade party but instead she's fighting for her life and all of a sudden her life is irreversibly changed.  She certainly never suspected that her friends and Simon, the man she loves, have the ability to shift into Pumas.  Sure she wants Simon but eating cat chow and using a litter box holds absolutely no appeal so what's a girl to do?Simon already suspected that Becky is his mate before the attack but he hadn't claimed her or even let on that he had any intentions toward her.  His mate's life being threatened brings out all his protective instincts and he certainly isn't about to listen to Becky's arguments against their mating.  It's a done deal as far as he's concerned.  Before he can satisfy his inner animal and mate Becky though he has to take care of her injuries and even then she argues with him.  It's when she tells him `bite me' that he sees the perfect opportunity to get exactly what he wants - to claim her.  There's no denying that they're mated after he's marked her as his!Livia's attack on Becky was completely unprovoked and makes absolutely no sense to her - all she knows is that Livia has suddenly sprouted claws and fangs and is intent on killing her.  It isn't until Becky's best friend Emma arrives that the pieces begin to fit together.  Livia's envious of Emma's status within the pride and believes that if she can acquire the Curana's ring then she'll be queen instead of Emma.  That's not how things work though and `Senora Psychopath' is in for a rude awakening because Max, Emma and Simon aren't about to let her get away with what she's done.  Livia's sentenced to life as an outcast and Simon carries Becky off as his new mate.  If Simon thinks he's simply going to claim her and they'll live happily ever after then he'd better think again.  Sure Becky loves him but she's stubbornly refusing to say the words, her change is taking longer than it should, and she's suddenly ailing and the doctor's diagnosis isn't fully explaining the odd symptoms.Dana Marie Bell writes this story with such humor and drama that I was quickly caught up in the romance between Becky and Simon and was unable to put this book down.  SWEET DREAMS is the second book in the HALLE PUMA series and flows beautifully from the first book WALLFLOWER.  Becky's feisty comments and loving nature really kept me chuckling and Simon seems to get a real kick out of her snappy comebacks.  I loved getting to know all of the characters in this story and they each quickly began to feel like treasured friends that I'll be happy to revisit many times in the future.I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more Dana Marie Bell's books in the future.  This story was fun, whimsical and wholly satisfying.  I'd definitely recommend picking up the other books in the HALLE PUMA series as well.  WALLFLOWER, SWEET DREAMS and CAT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR are all wonderful stories that truly capture the imagination.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies,1232668800,7,7,5,1

"For Christina Marshall growing up with an abusive drunk of a father is sufficient reason to not want a man in her life.  That doesn't stop her from being extremely attracted to two of her bosses, Jon and JT.  She's heard the rumors about them sharing women and is trying very hard to convince herself that she isn't interested in the two of them - together.Jon and JT have no qualms about their lifestyle or the fact that they want to make Christina a part of it.  The problem is that she's so skittish that getting close to her has been impossible - until now.  They've enlisted the aid of her friend Aislinn to help make Christina more comfortable with them.Aislinn is aware of Christina's aversion to men and alcohol but she also knows Jon and JT well enough to know that neither man would hurt her and judging by Christina's relaxed demeanor when the men are around she knows it too.  Since Christina isn't about to trust any man enough to start a romantic relationship, Aislinn suggests she indulge in a fling - just to get them out of her system.Christina follows her instincts and allows herself to be seduced into Jon and JT's bed for a sexual encounter she'll never forget.  Hours later she's awaken by the ringing of her cell phone only to receive the devastating news that her mother has died.  Christina's positive her father's abuse is what killed her mother.  Neither man will allow her to contend with her family alone.  Christina is going to have to come to grips with her feelings for them and learn to trust them - with her heart and her well-being.  She just may learn that there are some men who are not a complete waste of skin!Annmarie McKenna's THE STRENGTH OF THREE is more than a smoldering romance, it's a glimpse into the lives of children brought up in abusive homes as adults.  I really have to admire Christina for not only having the strength to stand up to her father and brother but for being brave enough to give Jon and JT a chance.  She's obviously afraid of history repeating itself but figures a fling with Jon and JT is safe enough.  Jon and JT are wonderfully alpha male and so intent on winning Christina's trust that it makes you smile just reading about them.  As for Christina's father and brother, well you'll love to hate them and the situation that led to Christina's mother's death.  Plus I have to tell you I got a real kick out of JT and Jon kidnapping Christina's guard dog to bring it to their home so she'd feel safer with them.  I can just see this huge dog going for these ex-military's gonads, too funny.If you're curious about Aislinn's story and haven't done so yet, be sure to pick up a copy of TWO SIGHTED.  I missed that one but I'm curious enough that I've added it next on my TBR pile.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies,1227312000,25,25,5,1

"I really liked this book. The characters were well-developed and the story believable. It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. There's a lot of sadness in Phoebe's life, and it doesn't look to get much better until a stranger offers his friendship. The characters are much like I would imagine they would be in the time period in which the story is set. I had to remind myself a few times that this story was written when women had few rights and were at the mercy of the men in their lives, as well as their surroundings. It was extremely rare for a woman to be able to live a self-supporting, independent life in those days, and I would imagine many had few or no close friends. This book made me want to reach into the story and clobber the bad guy, rescue the girl, and chastise the ignorant family members.

"This book is amazing! For the people that did not like it, you confound me. It is beautifully written and impossible to put down. Raven (the main character) is a gorgeous soul, who strives to save her not only her life but also her brothers in a battle of good versus evil. However, evil is not always evil and sometimes the bad person is not what they seem. This tale twists and turns and it is such a brilliant world of magic and possibilities. Heather Killough Walden has once again weaved an incredible story like no other. Raven must learn to deal with devotion, loss, lust, and pure unadulterated desire in this book and trust me it is a steal at the price. I have read this book three times and each time I find myself spellbound, shutting the rest of the world out while I live and breathe the life of Raven. Raven is torn between what she has known to be right her entire life, and what now seems right with her new knowledge of the world. She meets a dangerously beautiful man named Drake, who sets his life on the line for her. However, before she gets to be with him, he is viciously ripped away from her.

One, some of the descriptions were annoying. I know what the color of grass is and don't have to be told every time the grass is mentioned. Two, the author would describe something and compare it to  what was just written to make us see fully I suppose. If you enjoy that type of thing, that's great and I enjoy it in some instances to get a clearer picture of what is being described but some things don't need anything further. Three, the story ended abruptly. I didn't see it coming as quickly as it did.Even after saying all that, I really enjoyed reading this and would like to read more of the story.

First discovery comes because Trace is writing a fictional book about some of the events without understanding what it is all about.  Or is it fiction?  Events become intense as she and Boomer begin to realize the country may be in peril.Bob Mayer has created a compelling plot with characters that are mostly 3-dimensional and situations that are believable.  This is a story of conspiracy and of doing that which is necesaary even though it smacks of evil.  The ending is satisfying, at least to me.  But what would you do?  There is a wealth of descriptive material, especially about military capabilities, that add to the story.  This is a gripping novel of suspense, political and military type action with a twist of morality.  This is a work of fiction, but in our time could something like this happen or is it too far out?

Penny and Jace were such engaging characters, making great equal partners when it was called for, but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong, protective man at other times, and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two. The mistaken assumptions on both sides throughout the story became frustrating and by the end it was heartbreaking to see the characters following through with noble actions that neither of them wanted.

It captures your interest right from the beginning that when it ended i wanted MORE! The things the young girl ""Two"" had to face was awful, you want for someone to help her.

Silence was tracking him to give information to the leader of the Resistance (her adopted brother), but the hunted became the hunter.  And the game is on!!  This was a very good read.

"Ms. Forster doesn't make this story easy to read.  Instead she weaves a wealth of seemingly unrelated threads into a tapestry of amazing depth.  What some might see as a slow start is a masterful building of a solid platform leading the reader into a complex, satisfying story. I came to the end realized not once did she mislead me, I was just too caught up in the characters to see the subtle hint.  The iconic story of an ethical sheriff vs. personal disappointments, corruption, drug dealers and culture clashes would make an amazing movie. Unfortunately you would lose the most important part of the book.  Ms. Forster has always been an impressive storyteller but this transcends even her Witness series.

"Although I am a major fan of dystopic fiction, novels that deal with war and violence are an extreme turn-off.  This novel could well be the only exception to that stance. Uprising, in spite of it being an extremely bloody tale, is a very engrossing and entertaining book.The author, Justin Kemppaimen, is quite brilliant in his sci-fi depiction of Haven, the self-devised land of autocratic 'perfection'.  His characterizations are well formed and believable, his story-line is direct and fluid, his descriptions of the milieu are clear and concise and, lastly, the suspense he develops is compelling.  You will find yourself, as a reader, being led to a variety of conclusions as you read the story only to find out that the author had a completely different ending in mind.

There she opens up The Chocolaterie Store and raising their two children Mica and Christopher as a single mother.Friends set up Liz on a blind date with senatorial aide Carter Hudson.

Though she vowed never again Liz falls in love with Carter, who reciprocates her feelings, but she wonders if she can trust love after the Keith fiasco.THE OTHER WOMAN is an interesting contemporary romance starring a likable woman who though upset with her former spouse remains on good terms with him especially for the sake of their children as the character driven story line is kept focused on Liz.  Carter is an intriguing protagonist who sounds obnoxious on their first blind date, but proves first opinions can be false as he turns out to be a nice nurturing person.

"As the author of ""Abandoned China Dolls,"" I appreciate a novel that paints a true picture of romance. I honestly had a hard time putting this novel down. This is an excellent romance. It's nothing like those cheesy romances you used to read from Harlequin in which everybody and everything is perfect. In Ms. Lee's novel, the couple are both too insecure with themselves to admit their true love for each other. Instead they live day by day, happy but leaving their partner questioning their true feelings. Then Drew decides to give Sidney the ultimate birthday present. He gives her a fling with his best friend Brody. When Drew sees the look of excitement and satisfaction on Sidney's face, he is immediately jealous and insecure. Their little experiment turns into the hardest test that a relationship can go through, and they struggle with their true feelings for each other.

"This is an absolutely awesome buy if you're interested in starting the Steele series. Loved all the stories in this book including the first short story of Dane and Sienna. Loved all the Steele brothers and cousin Vanessa' stories. Chance and Kylie had a sweet and very funny coming together. Lots of mischief. Sebastian(Bas) and Jocelyn had a feisty and rocky road to travel. Also in that story was the very touching and loving story between Jocelyn's sister Leah and Reese the man she loved but left behind without a word.

Last but not least Vanessa and sworn enemy, the delicious Cameron Cody, who like Morgan has wanted his woman from a far for too long and is tired of waiting. Taking matters into his own hands, he lays out a proposition she can't, and deep down doesn't want to refuse.

"I read this in one sitting.  The book opens with a warning.  A strange young man has warned Selina that she must not go to Vastorn to heal the sick king.  The question, of course, is why, and it is this question that underlies her journey to Vastorn.  Along the way, a group of feyquin (similar to horses) stop her in an effort to prevent her from going to the king.The best part of this book is that the author kept me guessing as to why she shouldn't go to Vastorn and who doesn't want her to get there.  There was another surprise that popped up that I didn't forsee, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.  Overall, the book chronicles her journey to Vastorn (because she's determined to get there, no matter what).  But the question is really, should she go or not?  It was a fun read, especially the parts about the feyquin and the unexpected friendship that she develops with them.  I also enjoyed the night mares who proved that not all is what it seems.

"In Edinburgh George Lovelace, a retired Leicester University professor, visits Great Scot magazine editor and writer Jean Fairburn, a former academia also.  He provides Jean with a gold coin for her to authenticate which he insists he found while bird watching near his home that appears to be part of Bonnie Prince Charlie's horde he allegedly left behind when he fled for France after the Culloden debacle in 1745.  At the nearby museum, Jean learns that Lovelace brought in an antique last year so his story of needing her to help him with the law seems even more farfetched than when she first heard him tell her.As she travels to talk further with George, Jean arranges an interview with American dot com millionaire Rick MacLyon, who recently bought the local castle.  She arrives at the MacLyon appointment early having failed to find George before her meeting with the new lord of the manor.  While waiting she senses a ghost and follows her feelings only to find the murdered corpse of George.  As the police investigate, Jean finds herself embroiled in a weird conspiracy that ties back to the last Stuart pretender.THE SECRET PORTRAIT is a solid amateur sleuth tale although the heroine had no plans to get involved in a murder mystery as she only was interested in finding the ""mother lode"" left behind by Charlie.  The who-done-it has an intriguing late twist that fits the tone of the tale yet deftly will surprise most readers.  Lillian Stewart Carl provides a fine tale that cleverly blends history with the present (a trademark she is known for - see LUCIFER'S CROWN).Harriet Klausner",solid amateur sleuth tale,1116979200,5,5,5,1
"Aislinn is a little girl with big dreams. After the death of her older brother, she decides to follow in his footsteps and become a lady knight.

Aislinn learns that being a knight means putting the Kingdom in front of personal concerns and helping those that cannot help themselves. In a journey is fraught with danger and filled with adventure, Aislinn is forced to grow up fast. She must stay strong and develop the skills necessary to realize her lifelong dream.With sword fights, passionate love, mythical creatures, and courtly games, Woman of Honor is my kind of book. I love the idea of incorporating real history in fantasy, and Ms. Zoltack's book is based on the real life story of a group of female knights. Blending history with fiction, her writing is full of plot and adventure and her characters are strong and believable. Most of all, I grew to love all of them and cared about their hardships and successes.Aislinn is quite the main protagonist. She's tenacious and bold, beautiful and strong. The romance that blooms between her and the prince is well developed after years of solid friendship and teasing. I enjoyed reading about their secret courtship and had no idea how their romance would turn out!

Telly is pretty much a mess of a person when he attends a political rally and a fellow reporter is shot.  The original theory is that the shooter was attempting to assassinate the Jr. Senator from Pennsylvania.  This turns out to be a false assumption and Telly is smack dab in the middle of an investigation of a serial killer and is forced to look into his past of which he is not very proud.  Add a possible love interest in Cassie Jordan who worked with Telly but now is the national reporter for the New York Times and John Luciew begins to weave a very good story.There were times when I could have sworn I had read this book before, but couldn't find that it had been printed in a real book form.

Having met Ms. Bell at the RAW convention I fell in love with her amazing sense of humor. I had to find out if that translated to her writing. I am happy to report that indeed it does. I started with the first book in The Gray Court series Dare to Believe and I am hooked. Ms. Bell will be one of my auto buy authors for here on out.Dare to Believe introduces us to the Dunne family as well as the world in which they live that includes the courts of the Fae as well as the politics involved in the courts. The world building is seamless with the story and flows naturally and enjoyably.The love story between Leo and Ruby is fantastic and definitely steamy enough to get your motor going. With Leo being the hot alpha male we love and Ruby being smart but unsure of her own beauty they make a great couple and the humor and witty-ness of the author shine through in the dialog and situations that the couple and the family finds themselves in.This is a complete story but it does leave the setup open for the coming books and if you are anything like me you will sit down and read the whole series end to end.,A new auto buy author for me,1380412800,0,0,5,1

In fact I only decided to start reading it again because nothing else seemed interesting. Call it ""reader's block"".  On rare ocasions I actually have to force feed my eyes and brain, so I held no hope this book would break my current block, but I thought, ""What the heck and read a page on and off throughout the day until finally something hit my senses and a few hours later I was looking for the sequel!No spoilers here.

"It's a brief glimpse into the grief of a rural family, the Ridgehorns, that has lost its patriarch. Everyone is collected in the living room of the farmhouse and kind of fumbling through the proper way to discuss his untimely death and what's to happen to the inheritance.The story is steeped in that rough around the edges Southern charm with a Gothic bent that creeps up on the reader about midway through. The protagonist, Roby Snow, is a young man vicariously related to the family and lends a hand in the kitchen watching over the plethora of food that's been laid out, but which little is being eaten. He seems to have an invested interest in what's to happen to the family now that the father is dead, but it's not insidious and seems to be sincere in his concern for certain members of the family.Through much of the first half of the story, it felt like there was this odd preoccupation with food. The first scene was in the kitchen, so that stands to reason, but it seemed to go beyond that and I couldn't figure out if it was going anywhere or not. Fortunately, it started to make sense later on, and I was able to quit thinking about that and just enjoy the story.If you grew up in a rural area, you'll probably recognize a couple of your neighbors in this story--I did. It's a good story with very good characters, but not necessarily good as in likable. If you come across this story, give it a whirl. You might be pleasantly surprised.",Southern-fried southern gothic,1324252800,0,0,4,1

This magazine  gave me my 1st introduction to this genre of story.  I figured it was better to read a magazine dedicated to mysteries and suspense to get my 1st taste than to spend eight or ten dollars on a book that I may or may not end up liking.  I was not disappointed.  The stories I read were 1st rate and moved along at good pace rather than some books I've read that get so bogged down in details that it seems like it takes forever for the author to finally get around to revealing the plot of the story.  If you like mystery and suspense fiction then I would recommend this magazine.  If you're like I was and a stranger to the genre and just want to get your feet wet to see whether or not it's your cup-o-tea then I also recommend this magazine.,I very much enjoyed my introductory issue!,1396828800,0,0,4,1

She knew she had some serious decisions to make, but wanted to enjoy her family for just a little while.  Belle hadn't had a life at all.  She was working eighty hours a week with absolutely no friends or dates to take the pressure off.Belle Taylor had always had a crush on Rafe Bettencourt since she was a little girl.  They had been neighbors since before she had been born.  Even now grown up as an attorney, she felt the same tug at her heart when she was near him.  When she arrived home, her family was horrified at Belle's appearance.  She had lost a lot of weight, looked overly tired, and had the darkest circles under her eyes.  Rafe long considered family couldn't believe his eyes either.  He had stopped thinking of her as simply family since she had graduated from law school, and decided this was the time to make sure she knew she was his.  Rafe knew they had many issues to work out like the fact that they lived in two different towns, but he knew the time was right for them.Good Christmas story.

After he leaves the army, he must live one year scandal free if he wants a reward offered to him by the Prince Regent.Esme Danville lives with her abusive father who wants to marry her off to a man his age, if not older and just as abusive. Seeing no way out, she decides to become someone's mistress and thus get the marriage called off.  After seeing St. John breaking up with his mistress without laying a hand on her, she decides he is the one she wants.  After hearing her outlandish and most unladylike proposal, he refuses and ends up taking her to his brother's house, a place he is not welcome.  They do agree that they may stay under certain conditions.  The duchess tries to introduce her to eligible men without success.  Esme only has eyes for St. John who is trying to live down his infamous and deal with an addiction to laudanum he uses to deal with wartime memories.  It is hard to ignore Esme and his resolve slowly starts to crumble.After their inevitable return to London, Esme has to endure abuse from her father and despairs of not seeing St. John again.  He does get the reward and faces one challenge after another to  rescue her and get their happily ever after.Because I always wanted to know what happened to him after the end of the first book, I went ahead and bought this one.I think it is good and it kept my attention, something not all Regencies do.  I do recommend it to others who read the first book not only because of  St. John, but also shows how the people in the first book have prospered.  I do suggest they read the books in order as events in the first book are mentioned more than once.",An Unladylike Offer,1402704000,0,0,5,1

"I can understand why more readers haven't discovered H.P. Lovecraft. Many of today's readers prefer the sudden shock of horror featured in modern horror stories and films to Lovecraft's slowly building sense of unease. Lovecraft is the foul breath across the back of the neck or the cold hand that brushes your's in the dark. In other words, it takes a bit of work to appreciate Lovecraft's stories. Written mostly in the 1920s and '30s, Lovecraft may seem a bit outdated, but getting to know his tales is worth the effort.In this volume are 67 of Lovecraft's stories. I would argue that this collection is not necessarily ""definitive,"" but at least it provides a good overview of his work. Here are many stories in his Cthulhu mythos. For the uninitiated, these are stories of ancient gods who are at best indifferent to mankind's existence (and at worst outright hostile). There are also stories that stand alone and are creepy in their own right without the presence of ancient god-like beings. Many of his stories were originally published in the early pulp magazines, but don't let that questionable pedigree scare you away.Among my favorites are At the Mountain of Madness, The Colour Out of Space, Cool Air and ... well, just read them for yourself and pick your own favorites. A couple of minor caveats, however. First, Lovecraft depends more on mood and creepiness to tell his stories. For readers accustomed to horror that is both quick and gross, Lovecraft may seem curiously old-fashioned. Two, Lovecraft was a product of his times. As such, some of his depictions may come across as racist. Beyond that, enjoy these stories - whether you are reading them for the first time or coming back to them after years away. This collection marks an excellent point at which to start.",The literary equivalent of a cold draft across the back of your neck,1320019200,1,1,4,1

"Sky Mitchell, the lead singer in the popular rock group The Universe, goes to Baltimore for privacy and to make some serious decisions regarding his future with the band. He finds himself hiding out in an Irish pub where he becomes fascinated with what may be the breakout song for his solo album and its writer, Teagan Collins.Teagan has always been content to live her life doing nothing more than helping her family and the people around her. When she refuses to sell her song, Maybe Tomorrow, Sky challenges her to a contest, but the stakes have now gone way up. Not only will he win the song, but Teagan will help co-write his entire album. When it becomes clear that someone does not want Sky to break away from the group, those stakes suddenly take a deadly turn.Ruby Tuesday by Mari Carr has all the elements that I've come to cherish in a great love story. It has playfulness, sexual chemistry between the main characters and last but not least, a little suspense. Ruby Tuesday is the sequel to Come Monday in the Wild Irish series and it did not disappoint. Ms. Carr reveals another facet of the Collins family and it is a softer side. Sky and Teagan are a complex couple of tenderness and heat. Both come to realize many things about themselves and how they compliment each other. In the face of danger everything becomes clear and the ending is one you cannot miss.GiannaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Ruby Tuesday- A Joyfully Recommended Title,1274400000,1,1,5,1

"While I'm generally reluctant to take a chance on an unknown, unrecommended author, the good reviews and price prompted me to give this one a shot. I'm really glad I did!Cassandra thinks she knows exactly what she's looking for in a man: tall, dark, handsome, with a side of good in bed. But while she's busy trying to secure him, she almost completely dismisses the heat coming from another source. Lavey's humor really shines through in this one with a heroine stuck in the clouds and a hero who's not running from his attraction to her (isn't that nice?).My only complaint would be that some of Cassandra's ""lost in the clouds"" moments go on just a little too long for my taste.Honestly, Lavey is undercharging for this adventure. Though it's short, it's well-written and well-edited. I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing what she does in the future.","Short, sweet morsel of a romance",1299715200,1,1,4,1

"With an ingenious plot and sympathetic characters, Falling in Love Again is an entertaining light read.  There's a dash of humor, a strong romance, and a nicely woven plot with good tension between the protagonists.Mallory and John meet on their wedding day.  Mallory is only sixteen and John just a few years older, they are uncertain of each other and resentful as their parents have arranged their marriage.  John must marry Mallory so she can keep her beloved castle and John marries Mallory out of duty (he does not want to see her lose her home) and out of a need to please his father, a man who publicly claims John but privately eschews him because he is not really his flesh and blood.The day after the wedding John leaves and joins the military determined to forge his own destiny and not the one dictated by his father.  Over the years he sends Mallory funds through his uncle but basically lives his own life without laying eyes on his wife.  He returns to England and is a sought after lover and quite the man about town.Mallory finds John in London, in his mistress's house no less, demanding a divorce.  She has lost her home to creditors and she is infuriated at her husband.  John is astounded to see Mallory and even more surprised to learn that she has no home and that he is deeply in debt.  Seems his uncle has been siphoning off his funds and even worse loan sharks are circling him.  John knows he could go to debtor's prison if he does not find his uncle who has conveniently skipped town.  As his wife, Mallory could suffer the same fate so they now are on the run.John's friend lands them a job on one of his family estates, John will become a steward while his friend hunts down his uncle.  Mallory agrees to this plan mostly because she feels she has no choice, she wants to avoid prison.At first it was almost impossible to like John; he was selfish and irresponsible.  Mallory is completely justified in her feelings.  Their time as estate managers brings out the best of both characters and also their insecurities.  John realizes he is self centered and thoughtless; Mallory confronts her lonely life and takes a hard look at her reserved manner with commoners.  John is likable, smooth and smart and best of all sincere, when he feels something he does not hold back.  Mallory is more cautious, after all she was the abandoned one in the marriage and she is also uncertain in social situations, she lacks John's natural charm.  She gets beyond these hindrances and grows into a much more confident woman.  As she understands her husband her heart opens to him more each day.

"5 stars for this story. Throughout, your mind races ahead knowing the story must lead to a well worn conclusion.  NOT SO.. at many points in this story there are a multiple avenues the author could have branched off into another vein of thought and reach a different ending; produced a different story and that possibility, on its own, keeps the reader riveted.The author has a wonderful descriptive ability which brings his visions into the theater of my mind.  For me this is rare.  The author writes to his reader assuming intelligence, not dumbed down to simplistic 6 grade level and not overblown with needless tedious embellishments.I found this work in a collection of horror stories but this is NOT horror!

The Author indicates there appears to be an open door towards another war. However, this other war is the war of ideology. It would be very much like the Cold War we experienced between the Free World and the Marxist World. Along with that, there is a fair amount of fiction as Bulldog Drummond and his many relationships are all fictional. In any event, the Author has the unique ability to blend the two together.

"This is not the typical police story.  There is no page per minute action with fast-paced plot twists.  Rather this is an introspective poetic examination of an ex-alcoholic, ex-police woman, Andrea.  How easy would it be to like someone like her, with her lack of judgement, and self-mutilation habits?  Can someone this bizarre be appealing? Yet, by the end of the story... you will be on her side.  Andrea is now on a mission, selected by a secret police force, to rid the world of a serial killer, Clive, who had picked her up at a bar and had tried to kill her, only to later escape from maximum security prison.  She goes to Louisiana, posing as the killer's fiancee, and meets his modern day Adams family.  There, she waits, expecting him to turn up, so she can kill him.  We can even grow to understand these folks.  Good, evil and shades in between are mixed with the flavors of the South as Andrea lives with them and discovers their secrets.  Abrupt moments of extreme violence are balanced by Andrea's increasing attachment to the young girl in the family, also a victim of child abuse like herself.  I read this in a measured way, intrigued by the psychological drama and the sense of place.  The action-packed ending was not unexpected, and was a shocking contrast to the prior dreamy explorations.

"Thirty years before Sinclair Lewis publishedBabbittand set the standard for smug, self-important middle-class conformity, there was The Diary of a Nobody and Charles Pooter. Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?First serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since. If you give this slim volume a chance (available for free in the Kindle format), you'll see why. Despite being a century old, The Diary of a Nobody remains quite amusing and is laugh-out-loud funny in parts -- particularly in sections dealing with tradesmen or with Lupin's impetuous business dealings or love affairs. As long as there are self-satisfied petit bourgeois snobs, The Diary of a Nobody will continue to entertain.","a century later, still quite amusing",1366502400,0,0,4,1

"After reading the entire Star Wars:Legacy of the Force series I decided that I would commit to the next one, the Fate of the Jedi.  In the second book in the series (Omen)we are introduced to a new Sith culture, one that has been accidentally seperated from the rest of the galaxy for the last 5000 years.  This is very different from the ""There can only be Two"" Sith culture, which makes sense since they missed the whole rise of Darth Bane, the Sith Lord that founded the rule of two.This short story, The Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, is the back story on how the Sith ended up on the planet Kesh.  Set 5000 years before time of The Fate of the Jedi we are introduced to a galaxy full of Sith.  If you plan of reading TFOTJ: Omen, this will give you insight into some of the most interesting and complex villians to inhabit the Star Wars expanded universe in some time.  I am guessing there will be several short books in this series, each timed to gather interest in the Fate of the Jedi stories.  Far from being just a publicity vehicle I found the story intriging and engaging.  It adds to the legend of some of the baddest guys in the galaxy, the Sith.

"I've read entirely too many coming-of-age novels lately because I went into this one interested, but feeling like I'd read it all... yeah, not so much. This is more than a teenage girl finding herself, more than a the average 18-year-old finding himself. It's about a group of up-and-coming 20-somethings who help each other find themselves through love, laughter and fun.The start of the book is a little rough. It takes a while to get used to the ""episodes"" and it felt a little disjointed at first. I started out thinking it really could have used an overhaul to truly be successful as a novel. It also felt too short in places, but I usually feel that way about airy reads such as this.Having said that, this was a breath of fresh air. It was an easy read, the characters were all strongly written and the plot was well thought-out. I found myself alternatively loving and hating the characters, but always coming back to how real they felt. I didn't always agree with all of their decisions and directions, but it always made me smile.I recommend this chicklit book for those who want an easy read and a few smiles.",Not your average coming-of-age,1303603200,11,11,4,1

"I loved this book, I loved that characters were imperfect, I loved chemistry between them, but the main reason I am writing here is because I wanted to share just how much I hated one of the characters (not sure if it was desired effect or not, but hey one cannot help how one feels). Please feel free to stop reading, since it is sort of a rant that book just made me think of, it has nothing to do with the merits of the story, or maybe it does  have something to do with author's writing talent, since it invoked such strong feelings in me and only a good writer can do it  :).I hated Jae's editor, but hey I am biased, I have no relation to any celebrities, gay or straight lol, but I despise tabloid journalism, I despise it with passion. I think that even celebrity has their right to privacy and the person who destroys it is a vulture. But I warned you, I despise tabloid journalism, I am not interested in celebrities' marriages, divorces, affairs, etc, I know a lot of people eat this stuff with the spoon, I just really ignore these magazines.SPOILERS to follow, even though very minor ones, since the names of the characters which I am referring to are not the names of two lead characters.So since I happen to think that what happened to Hunter is completely a fault of this guy and his magazine, well, I was ready to slap Vega when he went into his self righteous rant about people like Hunter hurting people.Anyway, great story, thank you!",excellent book,1250640000,1,1,5,1

"Absolutely chilling.  The fact that unstable, psychotic killers can blend into society so well is what made this story so scary for me.  The writing was fast paced, the action suspenseful, and the plot very plausible.  Dan's character and escalating instability was very well written.  I do think Melissa's character could have been fleshed out a bit more as I really didn't get a very good understanding of her.  Just when I thought the story was finished and I felt safe again, thinking Dan and Melissa could settle down into their relationship instead of running for their lives, here comes a surprising gut-punching twist that left my heart racing.",Spine-tingling ending!,1257724800,3,3,4,1
"As the book description describes, this is a collection of 6 novels that are part of a vampire series.  The first five books revolve around a group of vampires and their Chosen as well as a despicable branch of the CIA known as DPI.  We follow them through the trials and tribulations of love while being hunted by the DPI.  The final book that is part of this collection revolves around another vampire and his Chosen.Each of these stories were well-written and I found myself fully pulled into each story.  With the first story, I became involved with the characters and really grew to love them as the stories continued.  In the first five, each story built on the last one and I got to know each previous character more than before as well as be introduced to know characters.This box set is a highly-enjoyable read and I look forward to the reading the second set as soon as I can afford it.

"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble, this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night, the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time, (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner",entertaining insightful look at the south,1131580800,24,24,5,1

"Burroughs' Barsoom novels were among the first science fantasy books I read as a child long ago. In fact, I still have all eleven volumes in their original Ballantine Books paperbacks stashed in a box, along with numerous works by Heinlein, Clarke, Asimov, and others from the 1960's and 70's that I can't stand the idea of giving up. At least I know I can read them digitally when I want to. Too bad the entire series isn't part of this set.Burroughs' writing style would be considered comically stereotyped and hackneyed by modern standards, but the themes of chivalry, bravery, and respect for others are timeless - even though they might be considered out of style by modern standards. Some ideas are worth preserving, and IMO these types of stories do that very well.I grew up with these types of stories.

"Mrs. Beast had me a bit confused at the beginning. I read the first few pages and thought I might might want to put it away, until I realized I was reading satire and a self-help book all-in-one.The book follows Beauty on her quest to turn her human, but sadly lacking husband back into the Beast who had won her heart before her marriage. Along the way, she meets other women who featured prominently in the Grimm Fairy Tales and listens to their tales of what happened Happily Ever After. Just like Anita Baker sang more than 20 years ago, fairy tales don't come true.Like many a woman who married because it was expected of her, or it was her duty, or she thought she could ""change"" him, these ladies share their stories of what went wrong, and finally, about what has made them happy.Along the way Beauty learns and grows, and like every good fairy tale, there is a moral to the story: instead of trying to change everyone around her and her circumstances to become what she wants, Beauty does the only possible thing she can do to make herself happy: she becomes what she needs instead of relying on somebody else to do it for her. It was a glorious end, and finally does credence to the line ""fairy tales can come true"".",Become your own desires,1334880000,2,2,4,1

Well written and a good story.  The book works on several levels.  One is the mystery and the second is a widow working through her feelings about relationships and her feelings about starting over and her faith.It was easy to connect with the characters though I would have given it a five it Lew has been a little better developed.  I thought the other characters were more three dimensional.I would certainly welcome a third book in this series though given the publication dates of the two books and the authors lack of other books under this pen name I think the two may be all that are forthcoming.,Just As Good As The First,1380931200,0,0,4,1

My coworkers thought I was crazy--that is how stressed I was for this man! The characters were all very well developed and I could have easily walked in any of their shoes. I actually got quite sad at one point in the book but I don't want to give away the story---all I can say it READ IT.

I really liked the two different narrative view points one of Dove Connelly the investigator on the case with some personal ties to the victim, and a first person narrative of Tessa Bradley.Both view points bring out hidden clues of what each character is battling at that moment, and a past that continues to haunt them.Every character is well developed through the on going story line. What really takes you by surprise is the sudden twist in turns of what we ourselves think of certain characters according to what they do for a living, Or their wealth or lack there of.So read this book with open eyes and see what you want to see and then see what we should see in other people.

"I read this in a couple of hours.It's the prequel to the Fallon Mates series.A little back ground into what the series is about and what happened on the home planet of the Vesti and the Amato, Belizair. Originally they were The Fallon. They separated into the 2 different species. Years later while at war with the Hotaling, another species who want their planet, they were infected with a weaponized virus that has prevented the females of both from falling pregnant. The Fallon, winged beings that once walked the earth and were revered as angels and demons. Some mated with the humans and so the genes were created.In order to prevent the extinction of their species the scientist have found that if 1 Vesti and 1 Amato male take a human female mate with the Fallon gene they are able to make babies. If a female Amato and a male Vesti take a male human with the gene they are also able to make offspring.This prequel explains how it came to be that both the Vesti and Amato were needed to create the babies.Liath d'Amato has been on earth as a bounty hunter. He offered his blood as others did and the scientists have found him a match. Her name is Cyan Dupre. She is an artist. After meeting Cyan, Liath starts to have dreams about the life he and Cyan will have once they are bonded. In the dreams he sees that the only way to happiness and offspring, is if he and his partner Rykken d'Vesti both claim Cyan as their bond mate. He spends time getting to know her and takes her to stay in a cabin. As much as he wants to mate with her, he believes the dreams are a true seeing. He goes back home to convince Rykken to come back to mate with Cyan.Rykken agrees to go back to earth and meet Cyan. As soon as the car pulls up and he sees her on the porch in the headlights, the Vesti mating frenzy takes hold. He must have Cyan, but he must also overcome the fierce possessiveness that comes with mating, not to share her with anybody. It is not the Vesti way. His friendship and trust in Liath's dream has been the only thing preventing him from taking her and claiming her as his.Laws of their world prevent them from revealing their true selves to Cyan until she agrees to mate bond with them and return to their home. Bracelets that have been made for Cyan are placed on her wrists. Once this is achieved they go the travel port where they both penetrate her and the bonding ceremony takes place. During the claiming and bonding ceremony Rykken injects Cyan with a mating serum through his fangs, the stones on the bands of Liath and Rykken fill with energy, separate and slide into place on Cyan's bands.

"Destiny Walker is nothing if not practical and logical. Love at first sight, soul mates and forever after are just fairy tales, not for her at all.

As she runs from the shop, she slams right into Superman lookalike Reece Kellan. Feeling an immediate attraction to Reece is something new for Destiny, something she really doesn't understand.I loved this short but hot story. Watching Destiny slowly discard all of her preconceived notions about soul mates and love was a delight, and Reece is the perfect man for this woman. I love that he never gives up on her, and liked the passion in their relationship as it grew and blossomed.

At 28 Chloe feels that her chance at love and passion was lost along with her youth and good looks. Travis's memories of heartbreak and betrayal by his faithless young wife haunt him day and night. There's no instant attraction, but somehow the two sense something, some kinship, that draws them to each other. Slowly and warily the two form a relationship, but romance is a bit of a minefield for these two guarded personalities.I suspected that I'd like this because it contains two of my favorite romance themes: People who have given up on finding love and a hero who has hit rock-bottom and is struggling to rebuild his life. I must say that the story exceeded my expectations. These two characters are vividly drawn and fully fleshed out - warts and all. You get a real sense of how hard Chloe's life was; how few options were open to her. Travis is a true tortured hero; a lost soul in need of redemption. The relationship plays out in a believable way and the author allows the sexual tension to build until the reader is just as anxious as the characters for that first physical contact. Very well done; very satisfying.Finally, while I know this is in no way the author's fault, the kindle version of this book is an absolute nightmare. There are major formatting problems with blank pages and awkward spacing, spelling errors galore and erratic punctuation. It's the e-book equivalent of reading a paperback with food stains and water damage. Too bad, because this is an excellent book. If you're stuck with the e-book version then I'd encourage you to try to overlook the shoddy presentation - it's worth the effort.No strong language and some fairly mild sexual content.",A disillusioned ex-con and a lonely spinster - does it get any better than that? -- 4.5 stars,1290556800,0,0,4,1

"I have just read CLAIMED BY THE HIGLAND WARRIOR AND SEDUCED BY HER HIGHLAND WARRIOR.Ms. Willingham had three others in her ""Accidental"" series on sale, so I snapped them up.This one, THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS, didn't have the things that bothered me in the others. The repetition was minimal and there were issues outside of the couple instead of things that could have been fixed with one or two sentences.Which made THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS a very nice read.Stephen has been gone, with no word, for months. He set off to find Emily's brother. Daniel has been returned to Emily, dead. As you can imagine, this has been very hard on Emily.Now Stephen is back, with no memory of marrying Emily and no clue where he's been, beside the tattoo, in Chinese, on his neck. While on the on the one hand Emily wants to fling her arms around her husband, on the other she really wants to smack him hard, or poison his tea. She knows that he was at his mistresses home just before he disappeared. HOW she knows that was never explained.That happens a couple of times in this book. Something is mentioned, but not explained. Lots of red herrings that don't go anywhere, and don't really fit with the story.To top things off for him, she tells him that they are the guardians of her niece and nephew. He really doesn't think that he signed on to be a father, much less a husband.Still, this was an enjoyable read.

"With A World Torn Asunder, the first installment in Derek Gunn's Vampire Apocalypse series, we enter a world where fuel crisis and economic collapse led to the fracturing of government and society. What better time for the vampires to step out of the shadows and claim the world for themselves? With a submissive population and some all too willing thralls, the vampires quickly took over. That hasn't stopped a small band of resistance fighters, whose guerilla raids on vampire strongholds have provoked a confrontation that may be the start of an all-out war for survival.Aside from the whole vampire thing, the scenario Gunn lays out isn't all that far-fetched, especially in light of recent developments in the economy and our dependence on fossil fuels. You can see how one or two catastrophes could lead to larger collapses. Honestly, I could have read a whole novel just focusing on that aspect, but I do love a good vampire story, and Gunn handles that part well. A World Torn Asunder has a fast pace, tons of well-choreographed action sequences and some very formidable bad guys. The book reads a lot like a movie, so it's easy to visualize the action.Where the book falters a bit is with the main characters. They're not bad, but instead of taking the time to develop each character, Gunn more or less gives us the ""back of the baseball card"" rundown of back story, personality, physical appearance, etc. It felt forced, and made the characters seem less real. It was much the same with the main villains, who conformed to a predictable type. I felt the book could easily have been twice as long (and twice as effective) if the author had taken more time and developed the characters more naturally. The book could also use one more pass-through by a copy editor just to clean things up and fix some issues with the appearance of the Kindle version.Despite those issues, I really enjoyed Vampire Apocalypse: A World Torn Asunder and have already orderedDescent Into Chaos (Vampire Apocalypse Book 2). I'd absolutely recommend this series to fans of E.E. Knight's Vampire Earth series and Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan's Strain trilogy. If nothing else, it's good to see vampires acting like the bloodsucking parasites they are, instead of sparkly love-struck teenagers.",3.5 stars - a promising start to an epic new vampire series,1324425600,2,2,4,1

"Do you like steam? Who doesn't?! My face was red as firecracker in the midst of reading this novel! The chimera mythology tied to PTSD and the soldier created an unique experience. Normally, one would expect that the chimeran-man would transform into a beast instead of becoming three separate beings. Adding in a wood nymph, a VERY sensual one I might add, was a remarkable choice. Initially, I thought why a nymph and a chimera? But as the story unfolded, it made sense and the steam rose in the room.The descriptions were eloquent. I laughed at quite a number of places, which I won't spoil for others, but the comedic timing was dead on. Ms. Draven's choice to use gambling metaphors and terms while in the casino and continuing to use that theme for certain characters enriched the flavor of language. The ending has to be another favorite. Spot on. I giggle aloud at the choice.",Steamy Mythica,1356566400,0,0,4,1

"As the candies in the title, this romance is sweet like sugar.Peter is a big pastry chef, he is at the top in every competition, but always second. He is again competing at a national level and again he has as an assistant Josh. Josh is a young chef who looks with starry eyes upon Peter: for Josh everything Peter creates is perfect, and when Peter loses, for Josh is almost a personal matter. Obviously Josh is in love with Peter but he has never had the courage to make a move on Peter, both since he doesn't judge himself worthy of the love of wonderguy Peter, and because he really doesn't know if Peter is gay, since the man never express an interest in him, other than for work.But this time Peter seems a bit more interested in Josh as a man than in Josh as a pastry assistant...The story is short, less than 40 pages, but really really sweet. I like above all the fact that Peter is really not a special guy, maybe he is even a bit overweight, and he is really a sweet guy; but for the loving eyes of Josh he is wonderful.",Peanut Butter Kisses by Pepper Espinoza,1238889600,0,0,5,1

"What I wanted to say is it's not a bad read but is it a good read?  Hmmm.Mom and Dad call their three sons together.  Hero's mom announces that she has dreamed of his bride and where to find her.  Hero is not very happy to hear that his days of bachelorhood are numbered which is very amusing to his two brothers.  He drags his feet before finally being forced by hunger to seek her out.  Because he has waited so long, he is overly hungry and stupidly frightens his future bride into calling the police on him.  Wait it gets worse.  Well I will let you find out how things work out but really I kept reading but I'm not sure if I enjoyed it.  If you like to read stories about ""true"" love where the hero and heroine hate and avoid each other and can't stay away from each other, here ya are.  I did not like that the heroine fought so hard to not want him.  All works out in the end of course, you knew that right?  But I seemed to finish reading it in spite of the couple not being very appealing to me.  So I would rate this as a good read with some reservation.

They are uniquely his and not a poor man's Stephen King like so many other horror writers I could name.Instead of rehashing the whole story from beginning to end and labelling it a review, I'll say this: I greatly enjoyed the characters, the suspense and the story.

"This book is wonderful! Not only does it have hot scenes between the three characters, but it has real emotions too - doubt, insecurity, faith, trust and love. Richard and Taryn are best friends and occasional lovers. Richard for the most part prefers men, but is attracted to Taryn.  They have an agreement to stop being friends with benefits anytime one of them enters into a relationship. Along comes Caleb and he's not only attracted to one, but to both of them. He wants them both, and not just for one night. This story is very well written. I love the characters and the way they make their relationship work.

"This was very well-written, in a romantic style.  At times, the author romanticizes war, then vilifies it.  Not that he is confused, I think that's how they related to things in that period.It still amazes me, and angers me, as a Belgian, how Germany managed to survive as a nation.  To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.  People who ridicule French military prowess have no idea of what they speak, and are, certainly, no students of history.","Short, But A Great Read",1359763200,1,1,5,1

"I enjoyed reading Blind Malice, the first book in the Rachel Myers Murder Mystery series. We are introduced to Rachel at her father's funeral and within a few pages the plot starts to build nicely. As do the characters, particularly Rachel and her old family friend Isaac. We are treated to some delightful descriptions of the Appalachian Mountain locale that this story is set in and, by the end of the book, I felt that I had entered into the life of the character for a short period of time.The book is relatively short (1800 locations) and a very easy read. If I have any quibble about the book it is that perhaps the plot falls into place too nicely. There were no red herrings or detours to provide that extra element of mystery.I noticed a couple of formatting issues. The book jumped between two different font sizes in the early chapters, and in the latter chapters there were several incidences of incorrect indentation.But overall a very enjoyable murder mystery and I look forward to reading more of the series.",Series off to a good start.,1266105600,7,7,4,1

She repeatedly kept bringing up how beautiful his women have been over the years making her feel insecure about her looks and the amount of time they would actually be together. He could have completely cleared her mind if he would have just told what he told the reader, that of the 2 years she has worked for him, he has not been with another woman sexually for at least a year and a half. That would have let her know that those women were just set ups by his mom and that he only wants her. Another thing was her constantly thinking that his family would not approve even though they are nothing but nice to her and include her in everything. Also, the fact that he would not just tell her how he felt. He knew she thought some of their together time was work related and just kept laughing about her questions about notes instead of just saying we are on date.

"Originally posted at [...]In the Dark is a love story in its own right. The way it's told, in flashback episodes, is a very interesting experience. Conrad and Desert Rose's story is one of passion, love, and secrets. Conrad is a strong and complex character, with a history as varied as the lovers he's had. Damian and Armand have both held places in his life, but for various reasons, are now just his friends, his comrades. Desert Rose is a survivor, one step away from homeless and lost. When she realizes the only hope for her children is Conrad, she turns to him for help. Conrad gives his word to Desert Rose as she lies dying that he will protect them.I loved these glimpses into the past, with a gentler, less cynical Conrad. But Conrad can be cold and unfeeling, and that is what finally drives Desert Rose away. That, and the discovery of his true nature as vampire. As a matter of fact, we don't meet Conrad in the modern day world until late in the story. Most of what we see of him is through the flashes of the past and his time with Desert Rose. He experiences Christmas through her eyes and falls all the harder. The research into the time period brought back pleasant memories for me, a child of those times. I loved the rich detail included in this story, and in the way it was told.This is a truly romantic story, but not for everyone. But if you are willing to take the trip back and forth in time, you will find a different kind of happy ending to a story.",A truly romantic story,1269388800,9,9,5,1

"First of all, this is not a short story collection, it is a single short story by Lydia Peelle, a sample from an anthology.  If this one story is any indication, then I want to get the entire anthology because Peelle is an artful short story writer.In This is Not a Love Story, she follows the story of a young woman, right out of college and full of pretensions and dreams, beguiled by the South, through a summer that challenges her illusions and tests those dreams.  Although it is a short read, the author draws her characters fully, and you feel that you understand them very well in their struggle to cope with their relationship and their uncertain directions in life.  I found it ironic that the one thing the woman wanted so badly to excel in, her lover could do better than she without even trying hard, and yet, he didn't care enough to try, nor see what this did to her soul.",One of those perfect short stories,1325289600,1,1,5,1

The story obviously revolves around an effort to prevent this, but also around an Iraqi pharmacist and his fiancee, half-sister of the terrorist, who are drawn into the situation against their will. The story is well written, face paced, and never boring. As with many of the 99 cent Kindle books, there are some problems with spelling and grammar but not enough to distract from the story. There were also areas that I thought were probably implausible with the Iraqi culture, but I am no expert.

"The allure of acting the independent working girl in London has faded quickly for Monica Trant, whose family was once quite wealthy.  A pretty dismal typist, she is sure she is about to be sacked when she is called to office of William Waters, the head of the Near Oriental Shipping Agency.  Instead, Mr. Waters offers Monica a proposal (literally):  pretend to be his fiancee for one year in exchange for five hundred pounds.  With a roommate who has broken her leg and lost her job as a ""mannequin"" and a brother who has wired for one hundred pounds or otherwise face some ethical charges in South Africa, Monica feels there really is no other choice but to take the offer of Still Waters (mockingly named thus by his typists), despite her resentment of the machine-like man and his offer.  And so begins what becomes a fairly contentious and awkward engagement.Comedy abounds in ""His Official Engagement,"" as does romance.  When Monica drops her meek employee attitude and starts torturing ""Billy"" for not only putting her a position that may have lost her an actual fiancee, but also for the aggravation he caused her as his employee, a battle of wills begins between the two.  But as Monica meets his Billy's lovely family and sees him an entirely new context, she begins to realize that Still Waters is an entirely different man than she thought, while the readers can infer how desperately Still Waters wants her to like him or at a minimum, to stop making things so darn difficult!I massively enjoyed this book.  It was like watching an old, glamorous film filled with witty dialogue between the female and male leads with lots of fun settings:  lunches at the Savoy, a Wales beach vacation, and a dingy and bohemian ladies apartment.  The narrative was fun as well.  Monica isn't an entirely trustworthy narrator; as she does her utmost to impress upon the reader that she isn't the type to fall in love, we see how desperately she strives to keep herself together as she begins to lose her heart to Still Waters.  I have to subsequently disagree with the other reviewer's comments about Monica's behavior:  for a poor young woman, she really is put in an odd position with the engagement and she really has no way of knowing whether Billy seriously cares for her or not.  His kisses offend her not because she is a prude (though that's how she plays it), but because she doesn't think they mean anything to him and she doesn't even know his motivations for the engagement.  But more importantly, if you hated your boss and you now have an opportunity to harass him a little, why wouldn't you????  I really adored ""Still Waters,"" as well and loved how easily Monica (who becomes Nancy mid-way in the novel due to Still Water's bungling of affairs) gets under his skin.  The two of them really do have some immature, but funny interactions because they quite simply can't figure out where they stand with one another and Monica is really hesitant to let down her defenses.  The secondary characters, from Billy's uncle and younger sister to Monica's obtuse roommate, are also pretty comical.I really cannot recommend this story more.  It feels both old-fashioned and modern at the same time and the narrative and dialogue were just so utterly satisfying.  I guarantee you that there are a couple of lines in His Official Fiancee that you will wish that you got to drop in real life!",Almost like watching a great 1930's film,1391385600,0,0,5,1

"This is the second book in the Dragon Town Trilogy.  The first book is Snapdragon Alley and the last is Dragon Town.  In this book, Argus, the 3-year-old from the first book, is a 22 year old man with a quiet life.  He is quiet and depressed, estranged from his family, an lives with a group of roommates that he doesn't really interact with.  He doesn't remember the experiences of the summer that took place in the first book.  One day, he is handed a mysterious package.  Those around him are intrigued, and everyone joins together to try to solve the clues.The tone of the book is fairly dark, and you keep hoping for a better 'Happily ever After' for the characters from the first book than is portrayed here.  But this is only the second book in the series - perhaps there is more to come.In writing about a book series that Argus is reading, this author writes ""They were genuine mystery novels, where the mystery often remains mysterious, unlike most books of that type, which should really be called 'solution' novels because there is rarely any mystery left at the end.""  That description is certainly true of the first two books in this series.  I'm definitely left mystified and wondering.  And yet, I'm not disappointed.  I don't feel that the plot was left hanging.  And somehow, I don't think I will be disappointed even if the last book in the series leaves me with the same sense of wonder - plotting and turning around all of my different theories in my mind.",A True Mystery,1307404800,0,0,4,1

I wasn't always sure I liked Paul, but I didn't dislike him, so I found myself willing to give him a chance based on Jo's past regard for him. Jo, I loved! She had crawled out from her grief and became an amazingly strong female character, as a deputy marshal, able to hold her own amongst the military world that Paul drug her into. She was no damsel waiting for her knight to save her. I found the mystical attraction between Jo and Paul a bit over the top, but didn't think it detracted from the story too much.

"Shy accountant Holly North can't believe she let her client talk her into filling in as the hostess Mistress Christmas at Sugar Plums, a Christmas-themed strip club. But, she has for some reason decided to go along with it, probably since she can't seem to say no to a friend in need, as long as she wears a mask.  She is surprised at how wicked it all makes her feel, and how she can let her lusty inner devil out.Detective Nick West is at the club, on his own time, trying to get Mistress Christmas to try and rob him, as his close friend claims happened to him.  He can't believe that the leggy brunette with the smoky eyes is the one responsible for the deeds his friend claims.  But she definitely gets his blood running at a fever pitch.Their attraction is mutual and when Holly blurts out her Christmas wish on the second night they meet he is only too happy to grant it.  The thing is one night might not be enough for either, can Holly reveal her real self to Nick? Will they both take a chance on love?But, with one misunderstanding it all might be lost.Mistress Christmas is a fantastic addition to the Wild West Boys.

"I recently got into reading period mysteries with the Maisie Dobbs series. After finishing them, I read ""Her Royal Spyness"", which I found to be frivolous and shallow by comparison, so I figured I'd try the Lady Julia Grey bundle, based on the reviews. I was not disappointed. The stories are interesting, with some good plot twists. I wouldn't really call them romances, although they do have a romantic undercurrent, and the dark character of Nicholas Brisbane grows on you after awhile. Lady Julia is a bit too impetuous, but she is a good foil to Brisbane, and I enjoyed the setting of Victorian England. In all, the three books are a good value and very entertaining.","Great value, good stories",1315526400,3,3,5,1

"Trench warfare, World War I, mage's, dragons, zombies, and cruel death; they blend together in an odd short story; that is, oddly, engaging.Certainly, not what I expected, the story opens with incredibly well built imagery of trench warfare. Tension is well built. The impending doom of a battle is clear in the language. The author does a comendable job of creating the rules for the ensuing battle.There is an inflection point where the mages are introduced, the story goes south for a number of paragraphs. The word mage is repeated a lot. The repitition is abrupt compared to the introductory paragraphs where the author chose words very carefully with little repetition. More fantasy words are used and then it becomes clearer, this is real battle combined with a fantasy land battle. Although I hesitate to say fantasy, because this could also be viewed as how Marten copes with the horror around him; although not real, he sees the mages, zombies, and dragons as if they are real.Fortunately the story recovers very nicely and flows into a comprehensible and vivid description of the battle. Once the author settles into the type of phrasing from the early paragraphs, the story regains its power.This is an interesting blending of styles, historical and fantasy. Aside from the transition point, a very well written, visual account that is an engaging read.",Good,1244505600,0,0,4,1

"It's not easy finding post apocalyptic or post global disaster books that aren't either over the top in one way or another and it's been many years since I've had the chance to read one that didn't seem too outlandish or just wasn't set right.Mr. Sides first book in his Peacekeepers series accomplished that. I read the sample and immediately one-clicked the rest. I found his story setting, details, characters to all be well-written, highly detailed in the places where details counted and easily understood. Each character, from Jim, Patricia and down to little Evan were all real to me and that is a vital element for me as a reader.The action was well-founded, not cliched as some of these style books can be and never boring. I enjoyed his dialogue between the characters. Now as for some of the complaints listed in other reviews, I didn't see it. I didn't see Mr. Sides treating his female characters in anyway that degraded them or made them lesser characters and certainly while there was violence in this type of book I honestly would have wondered about it if there hadn't been.

"Bought this book because I was a little intrigued by the premise and the price was very reasonable for a Kindle book.  Chloe was struggling to keep her house going and was need of a blacksmith.  Travis showed up after a long and difficult journey and promptly passes out.  Chloe reluctantly takes the man in and gives him shelter.  While not entirely trusting of Travis, she does give him the job.  Meanwhile she continues to live her life and try to hold on to her independence even though there is a gentleman or two would like to make her their wife.  In the meantime both Chloe and Travis' feelings for each other continue to grow.  Will they eventually accept what's growing between them and what happens when Travis' past catches up with him?

"I very much enjoyed this Jules Verne book.  It kept my interest most of the time.  I did think that some of the descriptions of the castaways' creations were lengthy.

"I haven't gotten around to the Repairman Jack novels, although I have been exposed to F. Paul Wilson's works.  I really thought this stood out, however; I'm not sure how to explain why.  Perhaps I feel that Wilson 'claimed' Jack more, somehow, or that he felt more strongly attached to or connected with Jack more.Regardless, I think that this is the best of Wilson's work I've read yet, and I couldn't put this down.  The writing is sharp, and I felt as if I were more in suspense while I read it.  I would suggest this to any horror fan, especially if they haven't read the RJ novels yet; I understand that if I read All the Rage that I'll reread this, but I honestly wouldn't mind.

"Your Health - Your pH: How To Reverse Illness and Gain VitalityI am always interested in books that deal with natural ways to deal with illness and positively affect your health. In taking care of myself, I try to consider the many aspects of health and the factors within the body, mind and soul that affect my health. One factor that I had never considered was pH, so this book offered a new direction for healing.

"A well written, engrossing story. It portrayed the difficulties of the battles in Iraq to a high standard. It was easy to understand the problems the troops there had to face and are having today in Afghanistan. No one can be trusted. Although I found the early splits in the tale of showing the day, date and time of the occurrence unnecessary and a bit annoying, adding no suspense the the goings on at all. Later on, however, these interruptions had merit when the tension was building - as it did superbly.

"Lovely! I finished this book with a lonely tear running down my face, perfect!James, the narrator, is a hardened man. Of all the things he had in his life, only the love for books has remained. When he meets Sedge, James is a paycheck away from the street. To survive he needs to buy the book for his sleazy client, but first his pride and then his attraction for Sedge get in the way. It's James himself that recognizes that he is not probably a model of integrity, but he acts with his own code of honesty and, even when he does wrong, he means well. What I appreciated more is that he's maybe depressed, but he's never bitter.Sedge is giving. He's also single-minded, outspoken and blunt, and a generous lover. The reasons why he's selling the book are altruistic and speak of a man of great ideals.When these two men meet and collide, what comes out is an unstable relationship that kept me turning the pages to see what good might come from such unpromising premises. We are in James' head all the time, so maybe that's the reason why he always seems so contained and closed and tightly wound. Sedge on the contrary seems always to projects himself to the outside. They couldn't be more different.The opposite backgrounds of the two main characters made them even more endearing and James' humor, a trademark of Josh Lanyon's narrators, made me highlight a few paragraphs. There's a masterly drawn encounter with an ocelot that is revealing of both James' practical disposition and Sedge's helping nature. The ending is full of possibilities.I recommend this book to everyone, because it leaves you with a warm and happy feeling.",A lovely story for Christmas,1291334400,2,2,5,1

"With the depletion of fossil fuels, technology came to a grinding halt, the war in the mid-east making the oil reserves radioactive for years to come.  The United States quickly developed into a new feudal society, with those with nuclear power plants charging enormous rates for limited power.  Without communication, each community was left to survive or persist depending on their strength and supplies.  It is then that the vampires came out of the night and began the enslavement of the human race.They were helped by thralls, humans bitten by vampires who were stronger and in league with their masters.  The humans were penned up in walled cities to give blood once a week and take the serum that makes them zombies once a month so they have no will to fight or even think.  However, there is hope because the resistance is alive and well and living on a military installation they call the Cave.  On a raid to get medical supplies, another group simultaneously was sent for food and the third group was sent to kill the head vampire Nero.  They didn't kill him, but they came back with the serum, a live sample of vampire blood and they have a scientist analyzing them to see what the serum does and if they can learn to make a weapon that will kill vampires at long range.  They discover if they don't find a way to kill them and soon, the serum will destroy what is left of the human race.Horror fans especially those who love to read vampire thrillers are going to thoroughly enjoy this paranormal apocalypse tale.  Although the humans are over powered by vampires, Derek Gunn's take on the mythos is fascinating, portraying them as sentient, long range planning beings who look upon humans as cattle.  The audience will enjoy watching David take on Goliath.Harriet Klausner",Great Vampire thriller,1161043200,3,3,5,1

The scene is light kink, nothing remotely over-the-top or anything.

"This is an interesting story about the mystery surrounding who will inherit Castlegate Manor.  There is a scheming cousin with pockets to let, a mother trying to marry-off her daughter without losing their station, a daughter trying marry her love and avoid marriage to said icky cousin, a beautiful young woman masquerading as a lady but without the proper pedigree, and a protective groom that seems more than a mere servant.  All the characters play an integral part in discovering the secret and unraveling the mysteries of the Manor.  Even a dead great-aunt influences the action as the story unfolds.I like the chemistry between the Hero and heroine.  It is a chaste relationship but the sensual tension is there; you can sense these two are drawn to each other and are fighting to keep their hands to themselves.  I also like that the h is as nice as she is smart and truly regrets any subterfuge she feels compelled to enact.  She is pragmatic and realistic but yet still has dreams of 'what could be' in her life.  The H is terribly masculine and a leader from the outset in spite of his lowly position in the stables.  The reader can guess fairly early who the groom likely is but figuring out the penultimate mystery keeps one turning pages.  The villain is truly nasty so it's easy to root for his comeuppance and there is plenty of tension and suspense as the action resolves over the last chapters.Without giving anything away, I feel some readers will say it is pure fairytale how the author deals with the disparity between the classes in her story.  History records several instances of courtesans and actresses marrying into the peerage, but the circumstances in this book make overcoming societal constraints highly unlikely.  In this story the servant is known in London and the peer is not high-ranking enough to pull off ""ignoring what anyone may say,"" especially as the resolution of the mystery would lead to much speculation in the Ton and most likely publication in the papers.  There would be no way to hide who married whom and what rank they were prior to the marriage. As a firm believer in the concept of true love and the adage that love conquers all, however, I do see these two characters marrying anyway and weathering the storm, retiring happily to the country to live their private lives.  I say disregard the fantasy of the match and just smile over the hard-won HEA.This was a sneaky little charmer of a book.  The writing style was clean and concise and the author kept the pace moving steadily throughout the book.  The secret was not terribly hard to figure out, but it was still worth reading to the end to see how the story would play out.  This was a nice, clean, light read for a Sunday afternoon.",sweet Regency mystery and romance with a touch of fairytale,1375747200,0,0,4,1

"I easily gave it five stars. What an engrossing wonderful story.Colin Baxter has been having dreams for two years. In his dreams, he is pulled to an island house with a red door. He feels the owner in pain, and wants nothing more than to ease his pain and heal him. Every night, he has the dream, and he starts to care for this dream man that he's never met. When his best friend Jordan is getting married, he suggests that they hold the wedding in Fiji where everyone can vacation and have a great time. During a boat tour around the smaller islands, he looks out across the water and sees the house of his dreams. He immediately returns on his own to meet the owner, and is stunned that it's Marek Donovan from his youth.Characters are rich and finely developed in this story. Both Marek and Colin are very nuanced and rich characters with their own personalities. Like Yin and Yang, the two characters complement each other while remaining opposites. Colin is optimistic, Marek is pessimistic. Colin is filled with love and hope, Marek is filled with guilt, shame, and fear. The third character in this book is a surprise... the house itself. Is it merely a repository of the negative emotions Marek has been feeling, or does it have its own desires?The writing is engaging and colorful, and the plot is beautiful. Not only are the characters finely developed, but they continue to grow throughout the novel. You empathize with each character and their hopes and fears. Like their love, the story grows, pulling you in deeper and deeper as Colin tries to break through Marek's defenses and Marek lives in fear of Colin's reaction when he hears the truth. There are highly romantic scenes, and when there's eroticism, it's charged.It's romantic, heartbreaking, beautiful, gripping, sad, happy, and an absolutely wonderful heartwarming tale.

Then you should buy this collection and read that book twice. Any thing written by Andre Norton or any of her Nom de Plumes is something you should read over and over till you have it committed to memory. I am some what surprised that more English teachers do not use Norton to encourage young readers. Children should be taught to have fun with reading. Read and learn and then learn from what you read.

"One of the most amazing things about this book is that it was written in 1914, yet resonates as a modern-feeling, romantic story somewhat along the lines of Sandra Bullock's 2009 comedyThe Proposal.  It doesn't feel dated.  Perhaps you can find the odd, quaint expression here and there or a few old-fashioned limitations on the male-female relationship, but the heroine of this story is a very sassy, smart, independent-minded female.Monica Trant is a well-bred woman now living in reduced circumstances.  She and her brother, who has moved to South Africa, are now the only two members of her family and she is forced to support herself as a working girl in 1900s London, pre-WWI.  Her boss treats all the ""secretaries"" impersonally and dictatorially and seems deficient in personality and human kindness.  As a matter of fact, the girls don't even think of him as a man, but more along the lines of an automaton.So you can imagine Monica's surprise when Mr. Waters asks her to become his ""pretend"" fiancee for one year.  He doesn't give his reasons but the 500 pounds he offers is difficult to refuse, especially when she finds out that her (worthless) brother in South Africa is having financial problems and has asked her to help him out.So she agrees and the story is off and running.  It's mostly written in first person POV and Monica's voice is sassy and funny, her inner dialogue at times a bit snarky but always amusing.  The characters' interactions and dialogue are a hoot and the story moves along entertainingly.  Monica is not fond at all of her boss, Mr. William Waters, at the beginning of the story and Waters is totally disinterested in Monica except as she suits his purposes because of his need for a fake fiancee.Well, you do know what will happen.  It is a romance.  But the getting to the HEA is a lot of fun.  This is worth the read for the romance reader and it's also a little slice of life in 1914 London for some historical interest.  I was charmed by how modern this old romance seemed.  (Berta Ruck, BTW, was born in 1878 and wrote 80 or so novels, mostly romances.  This one is, I believe, her first but it is very polished for a debut work.)","1914 version of the movie ""The Proposal""",1378944000,3,3,4,1

"I can't believe I got this book for FREE!  I hope others will take advantage of this opportunity to get a great read into their library. Furthermore, I hope that as a result, ratings for this book go up and the author is able to get money for it--or get money for it again.This book really spoke to me in places--very unlike any other work written for entertainment that I can recall ever having read.It's on a par with Jane Austen's works for its ethical code, it's so strict. I acknowledge that it does mirror Pride and Prejudice in its plot rather closely; nevertheless, it was original enough to hold me.I was fooled by the epilogue into thinking that there were actual historical figures in the book; it was cleverly done! I saw from other reviews, too, that I was not the only one. Even after having discovered my mistake in this, though, I credit this author with considerable merit for having the focus on something beyond purely domestic interests and giving the heroine credit for the same.

"As someone big on self improvement, I thought this book would be incredibly useful, particularly with its subtitle of ""quicker notes, better memory, and improved learning."" Who doesn't want that?The idea of mind mapping is that it helps you organise ideas. So instead of taking notes line by line, the idea is to place the central theme or keyword in the middle of the page and add more keywords surrounding it, with lines drawn between them to represent their relationships.According to this book (and now I know, it definitely makes sense!), mind mapping makes you more effective because this method is more compatible with the brain. This is because it matches how the brain functions biologically. Mind mapping also engages both halves of your brain at once, making you much more efficient and effective.A key poi nt, and one very important to me personally is that mind mapping is supposed to enhance creativity. As a writer, there are few skills which are more important! I imagine many writers would find mind mapping a very useful way of planning out their work, linking together various ideas, characters and plot points.As the book says, it'll be difficult to break my habit of making linear notes and the mind mapping will take practice. I've only really covered how I personally will find mind mapping useful, but the book covers a wide variety of ways in which it helps people, for example; note taking, brainstorming, collaborative writing, problem resolution and more.So if you're looking for a way to make your planning and note-taking go more smoothly and effectively, then this book is ideal.",An excellent resource,1299196800,18,18,5,1

"I'm not normally a fan of anything sci-fi.  It's not a genre I would normally pick up to read.  I'll be honest and tell you that the two things that even made me download and read this book were the hot cover and the fact that it was being offered for free. I truly didn't expect to actually enjoy the book.I was proven wrong.  From page one the story (and it's hot and steamy) has you drawn in and turning the page.  The problem with many erotica books are that while they may contain a lot of steamy and sensual scenes, they sometimes lack in plot and character depth.  This book had it all and you could find yourself, very early on, being invested in each of the characters and wanting to know where they would end up.If you are like me and usually turn away from anything sci-fi, make an exception with this book.

"This is one of the top 5 Harlequin Presents books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of them. I think the best part of this book is that it is presented in a new way.It doesn't have the normal plot of jealous ex's or false pregnancy claims on the hero. This book shows how far a family is will to go to follow traditions and what they feel is in the best interest of their family even at the expense of hurting those involved in the deception. It shows how much Luc is willing to give because he regretted his past choices of those he believed wouldn't do him wrong. I loved how Skye wasn't selfish and realized how much Luc was sacrificing, even though he told her he didn't care. It shows how much she truly loves him. She took the initiative to try and correct past wrongs even though they were against her. It takes a lot of courage and love to do what she did.

"In the 1970s I was an avid sci-fi reader and my close friend also read sci-fi and we often exchanged books.  She was an Andre Norton fan and I was not.  I was more into Heinlien, Clark and our leader, Isaac Asimov.  Not until these more than 30 years later have I discovered this wonderful writer.  What I've been missing is exactly what had been missing in the sci-fi area of my life.  The Starborn is a story (only one of many stories in the book) of a world called Astra which many centuries earlier was found and shared life with humans after a long sleep aboard a ship from Earth to escape an evil leader there.  Lo these many centuries later, and not so long in travel time, comes again humans.  There are many intelligent life forms on this planet and, of course, good must conquer evil as it does so magnificently with a man from Homeport and a Johnny-come-lately from Earth who share the secret of each other until the time is right for humans to learn of each other in the future.I think the reason I was not a fan of Norton in the past is the planet name of Warlock in one of the stories.

"My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella to Rachel Vincent's popular series, Soul Screamers, which I have yet to read! While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.The story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.Rachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!This is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so!

"This is the fifth book in the original six book Lost Fleet series.  I consider this to be the best Space Opera series which I have read.  After 4 books of tactical genius and reasoned risks, Captain Geary and the Alliance Fleet are within a handful of jumps to Alliance space.  Captain Geary struggles as the risks seem more tangible as their final destination seems so close.  Fleet opponents become more desperate as they realize that there is little time to displace Captain Geary.  The Syndics are not content to be counted out and still have some cards to play on the seemingly invincible Alliance fleet.  Many plot lines come to epic conclusion in this book which I find has the best ending of any of the books in the original Lost Fleet series.Each book builds on the previous so it is important to read the books in order.  The first Lost Fleet Series consists ofThe Lost Fleet: Dauntless,The Lost Fleet: Fearless,The Lost Fleet: Courageous,The Lost Fleet: Valiant,The Lost Fleet: RelentlessandThe Lost Fleet: Victorious.  Author has also started a new series,The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier: Invincible, in the same universe.The Lost Fleet: Relentless is 4,548 Kindle locations long.  Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.  Longer novels can range from 15,000 to 20,000 plus Kindle locations.",Awesome!,1358726400,0,0,5,1

"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction, break up, apology) and emotions (oh how could he, I hate him etc), I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read.",Sweet love story,1345334400,0,0,4,1

"Carefree and making their way across Europe, Peter and Anne meet a group of locals in Amsterdam willing to show them around to the various sites and galleries.  Finding their guides fun and engaging, they agree to accompany them to their home in the outskirts of town and enjoy dinner, desert, and new guests who arrive during their stay.  As the alcohol flows and the night drags on, Peter and Anne agree to spend the night in the Amsterdam couple's old windmill recently converted to a guest bedroom.  After a restful and relaxing sleep, the young couple make their way to their guests house to help clean up and start breakfast.  Inside, they find their hosts brutally slain bodies.  What follows is a harrowing escape from Europe that will not only change their lives, but the course of the world.In Amsterdam 2012, Ruth Fransisco paints what I would call an alternative reality of a potential future sequence of world events.  Similar to the assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand which started World War I, Fransisco shows how these slayings in Amsterdam begin the start of World War III except this time, it is a war of Islam versus the rest of Europe and the United States.  I can understand the comments from some reviewers regarding the unlikely series of events or the speed upon with the Jihadists can take over so much of the world.  But this is why I call this an alternative reality.  Fransisco is hitting readers over the head with hyperbole of some of the potentially politically correct leanings of this country and how far it could take us if we aren't home watching the store.Do I think events could unfold as described?  No.  Do I think the book is thought provoking and compelling?  Absolutely.  Those who like a more subtle approach may not enjoy this read and would not find the United States to be so willing to embrace such radical cultural indoctrination.  Having said that, Clavell's bookThe Children's Storyfrightening shows how easily and quickly it is to change beliefs.  My estimate is this book will polarize readers but all will come away thinking.",Amsterdam 2012  - Thought Provoking Alternate Future Reality,1275004800,1,1,4,1

"This remarkable novel follows the journey of two mind-melded companions through the dangerous landscape of a post-apocalyptic future Earth.  By healing a wolf, a mentally gifted man gains a lifelong companion who travels with him to visit legendary north-country tribes.  They meet extraordinary characters along the journey and discover a destiny that is sure to shape their future.An important destiny awaits the bonded travelers.  Will people seek out technology that nearly destroyed Earth or follow the path of nature and self-discovery?  The author's vivid descriptions of places and people takes readers into a mysterious future world filled with danger.  The journey is worth taking and the characters are worth knowing.This is the second book in the Shape Shifter series.  It can be read on its own, but the reader will get a much better experience by reading Syren Song first and then reading Melder.

"I'm not a fan of scary, horror-filled books, but this one, filled with humor and wit and action, may make me change my mind.  It certainly made me a fan of the author (I just bought his other book).One thing I admire most of all:  this story was clearly a novella-sized idea, and the author did not try to pad it out into a 300-page novel, as so many authors do, thereby producing a bloated whale.  He let it run the length it should be, and the result is a very nice, tight, ingenious story.None of the characters is a stereotype; not one scene is over-the-top hystrionics.  Good solid, vivid writing.  I loved it.P.S.  I found three errors.

"Caleb is a wolf shifter and Sommer is a female AA whose adoptive family belong to Caleb's pack. When her parents were killed in a car wreck, Caleb's dad (the Alpha of the wolf pack) rescued her and gave her to a couple in his pack who could never have children to raise.

"I picked this book up when it was free because it sounded like it might be a fun, if typical, light romance.  It wasn't.Brief synopsis:  Smart, competent, respected pediatric surgeon Holly Bell falls hard and fast for celebrity baseball pitcher, Nate Carter - a player, and not only of the baseball variety.Here's what bothered me most about this book.  I can't stand the insta-love.  For no good reason that I could see, other than the fact that he's hot, the super-intelligent Holly decides after 3 weeks that she's madly in love with Nate and demands (yes, demands) a commitment from him.  Because, even though she knew of his reputation with women when she started dating him, she decides their 3 weeks together are special enough to expect him to suddenly change and declare his undying devotion.  But the thing is, there's really nothing special about Holly.  She's all kinds of blah.  So why would Nate change everything in his life for a whiny woman?  Got me...but he does.  Eventually.  If she had demanded this commitment after 3 months, I wouldn't have had a problem at all.  But 3 weeks?  Sheesh.Add a run-of-the-mill psycho stalker and that's pretty much the whole book.  Not entertaining, not light, not even all that romantic.  Honestly, I forced myself to finish it.

"This is the very first Kindle book I haven't been able to finish since I got my Kindle a year and a half and countless book downloads ago.I really, really like techno-thrillers.  I was really, really looking forward to reading this.  Instead, I found I kept setting this book aside and reading other books (all of which were highly entertaining).  I just couldn't get into this one.Finally, I gave up on it entirely at the end of Chapter 14, which is a quarter of the way through the book.  That's an awfully long way to go in hopes that things will happen...or at least become interesting.Yes, based on some of the reviews, it sounds like something actually resembling a plot finally starts happening right about where I gave up, and that it does improve, at least somewhat.Unfortunately, I no longer care.The characters weren't compelling enough for me to care about.  They seemed awfully one-dimensional and stereotypical.In addition, I found that telling the story in the first person, but swapping who that first person was...for chapter after chapter after chapter after chapter, flipping back and forth between two characters...was annoyingly distracting.  Had the characters spoken in distinct ""voices"" (or had I been reading the book at one sitting), it might have worked, although I never saw a compelling reason to write it this way.  However, I thought the two characters sounded identical, which made it impossible to tell who was speaking without being 'reminded'.  (I guess I expect books to flow...and this one didn't.)Plus nothing really happened.  A quick kidnapping right at the beginning.  Then nothing.  Again, for chapter after chapter after chapter.  Nothing.  Finally, in Chapter 14, where I stopped reading?  One of them woke up in a cell (he'd been in his apartment), then had a vision about a pretty dream world - a vision that took up most of the chapter.

She didn't for me.  I thought Feb was immature and stupid for 20 years and I thought Colt was immature and stupid for 20 years.  I thought Feb more so.

"I couldn't find anything to like about this book.  I didn't like the characters and found the background story on the main characters wasn't developed enough for me to care.  I think the author did herself a disservice because this first novel felt very rushed and incomplete.  We were immediately thrown into the action with characters we had not yet had a chance to get to know and care about.  Then again, what was there to like about the ignorant, money-grubbing Daisy, cunning and crafty Aiden or Peter the Lunk Head?  I was appalled when Aiden admired Daisy's intelligence when she was going on about her business plan talking about ""those people"" (Koreans) so ignorantly I actually winced while reading.  She didn't sound smart; she sounded like a bigot and a hick and someone too young and experienced to have a clue about the world outside of Hollow Creek, KY...which I guess is what she was.  Aiden was so outrageously conniving it was almost comical.  All he needed was a long mustache to twist while laughing maniacally over Daisy tied to a railroad track and the image would have been complete.  Peter was such a chest-thumping, keep-the-woman-barefoot-and-pregnant caveman that the moments where he was supposed to be breaking down and showing his softer side almost didn't make sense.  Also, when Daisy's big (and obvious) secret was finally revealed in a dramatic (and predictable) fashion to Peter; I didn't feel sorry for either character.  I was actually very happy that this little bit of drama had finally come to its predictable conclusion.On a side note:  I found it extremely annoying that Daisy and Peter kept referring to Jessiemae but we never met her.  Here was a character that sounded like she might have a little bit of complexity and she never makes an appearance in the story!!Anyway, I downloaded the second novel, Daisy's Choice, right after completing this bit of fluff and it immediately became apparent that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in the first novel by giving more background on these characters.  But at this point, I find these characters so revolting and unendearing that I no longer care to see them get to, what I suspect, is just another predictable happily ever after.  I returned the second novel and am certian I won't ever reread Aiden's Game.  This is not to say that I am finished with this author because I know she can do better than this trio of stereoptyped, two-dimensional characters.",Hated the characters!,1362528000,4,4,1,-1
"I really didn't like these headphones. At all. To make sure I wasn't crazy, I had my husband (who likes in-ear headphones more than I do) try them too and he agreed. Because of the vacuum seal, I actually had to take one ear piece out for a long call.Short version:- Sound is decent.- Fit is weird and uncomfortable.- Materials are ok but feel cheap.- Case is useless.Sound quality: actually pretty decent. However my Jabra Supreme bluetooth sounds better and has more bass. The headphones are pretty quiet as well. The mic was ok.Fit: Terrible.- Size: These come with 3 sizes of ear buds. I tried the smallest and they still felt uncomfortably large in my ears. The smallest size is similar to the middle size I've received with other headphones. They fit my husband better but were still not comfortable.- Vacuum seal: These headphones seal your ear canal which is great for noise cancellation but also means you hear your jaw move... And I find the vacuum seal really uncomfortable.- How they sit in the ear: we both felt these didn't sit right. It takes some fidgeting to get them in the right place. Maybe with practice you could pop them in and have them where you want, but I've not experienced this need to adjust with other in-ear headphones.Materials: Average quality but feels cheap.- Cord: Rubberized or plasticized and slightly thicker than average. It feels cheap. It's also just long enough to work between your pocket and your ears... barely. (We're tall, but not crazy tall.)- Cool looking windy-case: I loved this in concept. In reality, it was annoying and basically useless. The case isn't flexible enough to let the cord and bits on the cord (like the mic or connector where the wires split for the earpieces) wrap into the spool easily. For the bits on the cord, you have to carefully push them through the plastic gap or open the gap further. Unwinding is just as annoying, possibly more so if you need to take a call.",OK?

"I have read the author's other books and liked them.  This seems like a first draft where she is trying out what will ultimately become a winning formula.

Cannot fathom why the main male lead would have wanted her from afar particuarly after he got close up to her.

"I hate to give a book a bad rating, but sometimes you read books you just don't like. I wanted to enjoy it. I really did. I forced myself to read about halfway through, hoping it would get better. It didn't. The characters are flat and the situations are far too convenient to drive the story forward. One kid is an expert with computers and can hack anything in twenty minutes. Obviously the author does not know anything about real world computers and security. Another kid was a very convenient electronics expert. Whatever the need was, a kid could do it.The author told the story in a very and then... and then... progression of storytelling. While she tried to build up suspense at the end of each chapter, it really had all the suspense of a Sponge Bob commercial break. There's a writer's credo that says, ""Show, don't tell."" Ms. Jewell did a lot of telling and very little showing, which provided little sensory enticement. And then... and then... and then I reached halfway through the book and decided I had better books to read. Sorry. Nice try, but the mark was missed.

"Robyn Maxwell had been looking forward to an annual trip with her brother at Granite Lake cabin in the Yukon wilderness. When he cancels, she doesn't let the fact she's deaf stop her.

What he doesn't plan nor doesn't he need before this death-to-the-finish challenge is to find his mate and that's what Robyn is.The chemistry between Robyn and Keil might be there, but I wasn't feeling it. What I did like was Robyn's character. I also liked the location, but I wasn't feeling it for Keil. I also didn't buy the fact Robyn didn't know that she and Keil had a commonality.

"I enjoyed the atmospheric opening and the descriptions of the locales, but the story took about three times to tell as necessary. This wasn't helped by the fact that the heroine's decisions become increasingly difficult to comprehend and so much of the explanation of why she never does the obvious and logical thing each time she has a choice comes so late in the book that it's likely almost impossible for the reader to identify with her reasoning. She seems by far a weaker rather than a stronger character because of this. The final resolution seems equally incomprehensible; a good literary surprise comes as the inevitable twist that you should have seen coming, but this was simply out of left field.Some of the heroine's self-realizations are intriguing and well-written, but rather in the same way that the author repeats the same scenario over and over, she repeats these moments of self-awareness again and again.Two stars for the descriptions and atmosphere.",Good atmosphere setting but the plot loses focus and becomes repetitive,1310428800,13,13,2,-1

Each woman having a different story, but then quickly after reading passed my downloaded Kindle sample, the story quickly went downhill for me.  The Tamara character should not have so easily forgiven her Kell guy and I really felt the author should have started the book from their first encounter and not one month later - would have perhaps made it more understanding for Tamara to have forgiven her sorcerer boyfriend so quickly.Also with the character of Penny, there should have been more story time and not such a quick falling in love between her and the king.  Of course you can see why she would want to marry the king, but the love at first sight for him to her, sorry not believable and plus as a reader you want to be drawn in, not just have this abrupt ""love you, you're not my protected.""What a shame as the first book of this series I rated 4 stars.",Ahh gee what happened with this one....,1326412800,2,2,2,-1

"Again I have to write a less than stellar review and unfortunately, again, many of the issues would have been addressed and rectified in the EDITTING process. That said, here goes:- A period is required at the end of a sentence, even if the end of that sentence is dialogue and encased in quotation marks.- Very repetitive. He does, she doesn't. She does, he doesn't. What was probably supposed to be drama, when repeated over and over and over is not. The inability of the main characters to believe anything but the worst of each other leads the reader to conclude they are morons rather than successful adults.- Phrases joined together all over the place with commas and conjunctions when they should have been separate sentences.It's pretty basic: you can have the best story idea in the world, and you may even be able to write it, but if you don't get an EDITOR to tighten it up and correct the errors you can't or don't see, it ends up reading like a teenager of average intelligence wrote it for an English class.This review sounds snarkier than I intended, but I'm getting really tired of reading uneditted books (I think most of you have figured that out by now).",Cute premise that went on too long...,1364947200,2,2,2,-1

They only feel regret over they are proven entirely wrong, and only then seek to find her? I can't recommend this. It is one of the worst things I have ever read, and it came from Maya Banks?

"I agree with R.Gill that , ""This book is a very long lecture on the evils of Republican Christian gun toting meat eating humans.""  The religious leaders in the book not only drugged their flock to keep them in line (more than one group did this) but one group even went so far as poisoning anyone who disagreed with them including children. Really?I found it hypocritical that the main character believes in letting everyone live their personal lives yet the whole book was written to consistently dump on groups that obviously disagree with the author's point of view.  So in short the only good guys in the book are vegetarian atheists and strangely enough one Buddhist.  I guess Buddhists make the author's cool list to.The best part of the book were the chapters written from the dogs point of view, very well done and enjoyable.  It is a shame that the author had to spoil the majority of his book with constant bashing.  I would not have mentioned it, if it occurred only once in a while, but it was pervasive throughout the book.And, so you don't think I don't like the book simply because of my point of view, here is a another quote from a review by Brian Garst:""Unfortunately, the story was held down by the author's apparent hatred for all things religious. I'm not a religious person, so that doesn't bother me per se, but when it drags down the story with silly characterizations and predictable plot lines, it becomes a problem. Simply put, everyone evil is religious, and everyone religious is evil. It gets boring, quick.""",author hates all things religious,1324166400,15,15,1,-1

There were just a few things that I simply couldn't get past.SPOLERS in my review, I'll do my best to keep at a minimum.First, I felt that the ""love"" happened FAR too quickly - I didn't buy the feelings at all, there just wasn't enough time for that sort of depth to develop, even if you believe in love at first sight.  Second, Two accepted that she was a vampire far too quickly - I didn't buy that either.  The main problem I had with this book was the lack of emotional depth.  I thought the writing was amazing - gritty, and more explicit in some ways than I normally prefer but as I said, it pulled me in.  I just couldn't get over the fact that the relationship didn't seem real to me.  I wish I could have because I think the direction this writer was going in as far as vampire lore was fascinating.

"The only reason I read this book because it was free on amazon, i would have been upset if I paid money for it.  It was a sweet story which is why I gave it 2 stars, but it was boring.  not much romance, the majority of the book centered around the 10 year old boy.  The characters did not seem to have a connection.  There was just a whole list of things that were off in this book.  As one reviewer said the ending was really abrupt.  It was a short book (thank goodness) but the entire time reading it I was thinking 'when will this book be over'.  i ordered the 2nd book to this series, also a freebie, but now I am not sure I want to read it.",glad it was a freebie,1320710400,1,1,2,-1

I lost interest and therefore lost who was who, etc. There was nothing wrong with the book, it just was not to my liking.  I see that I am in the minority as most reviewers liked it.

"You know when you pick up a magazine in a waiting room somewhere and read the articles in order to pass the time,  and are reasonably pleased if one of the holds your attention long enough for you to finish it?  Well that's the sort of 3 star rating this novella gets.  Yes,  all the words are in order,  they make reasonable sense (though why Jane swore a year of celibacy and how her friend can work professionally with these people and act the way she does is never explained) but this is not enthralling or hot or anything much,  just passable.  A weak OK.Jane one minute acts like an experienced sub, and the next she's hesitating over the simplest of tasks.  She doesn't really work as a character and I have no desire to actually buy the next two books and see what happens next,  there are enough cliched characters and situations here...  this is common tale retold without wit or warmth.",only worth it because it's free,1283472000,1,1,2,-1
"Good lord.  First let me say this book is just like a thousand others written for Harlequin back in the 1980's.  He's rich, she's poor, he manipulates her into doing what he wants. Yada Yada. This woman was a spineless jellyfish. The thing that bugged me most about this book was the editing, or lack thereof.  (And this was the second version?) In most of today's romances, both sides of the story are told.  There is a brief try at that with this one, I think there two paragraphs from the hero,  and he is never heard from again.  The hero is never really introduced, his name is just mentioned in the middle of a sentence.  He owns a huge corporation, then he is a Count, and his aunt is a Countess. But his uncle married to that aunt is not a Count. Then the title is never mentioned again. Huh?  Then there is the grammar.  I think this was edited by someone who has English as a third or fourth language.  Example, ""Oh, but there are plenty of things none of you doesn't know about me."" and ""She shouldn't be pulled into this holy mess at all.""  (I think that is UNholy).  I gave this one star just because the errors made it funny.  It was an old, predictable story, with more holes in the plot that Swiss cheese. Unless you like laughing at the grammar, don't bother with this one.",Are you serious?,1311379200,10,10,1,-1
"This story follows a woman's lifelong so-called friendship with(which primarily consists of being used by) an immensely self-centered and vain man who happens to have earned a lot of money.  While the writing was mostly enjoyable, the heroine's inablility to face reality about herself or her friend made me very frustrated with her.

I wanted more background information about the characters, give me some answers to the 'why' I am asking myself.

"Twists on fairy tales have been really hot for the past few years and these two short stories (setting up what looks like a longer series) are firmly in that camp.  While the stories go along at a really fast rate and the reader is swept along, they aren't all that fulfilling.  Part of that is the main character, Veronica Grim.  She's a perfect cypher -- no flaws, no worries, no problems.  Making her a bit more human (although she may not be human -- I don't know) would have made these two tales a much more engaging introduction.  Reading about a fairy tale Superwoman isn't all that fun.  The other issue is with the world -- it's unclear if the characters know they are fairy tales or what the rules of their world actually are.It's possible that both of these issues are dealt with in a satisfactory way in the longer works in this series, but based on this intro I don't have much motivation to keep reading.","Pretty standard ""twisted fairy tale"" stuff",1386460800,0,0,2,-1

"I was not impressed with this book.  Many parts were much too drug out, and some parts were just plane confusing, it read like it needed a good proofreading.The story would have been better if the characters were older. I don't see any reason why they all had to be so young, in fact their ages were a big part of what made the story unbelieveable to me. Shawnna managed to graduate highschool early even though she had a terrible upbringing and even spent time living on the streets. It would have made more sense for her to just graduate at a normal age and be a year older then she was. Conrad was only 21 and a lawyer. There is no way he could have finished undergrad and law school by 21. There was also no reason for him to be so motivated to get married and start a family when he was so young.  I just did not buy it.The character development was not very good. With good charcters I am able to get lost in the story and feel like they are real people.  The characters in this book did not feel real to me.The ending was also a disappointment, it was over the top and too cheesey for me. It did not fit in with the grittyness of the story.I gave it two stars because it was good enough to finish and I did not feel like I totally waisted my time after reading it but it is not a story that is going to stick with me, or that I would recommend to others.",Not very good,1344211200,2,2,2,-1
